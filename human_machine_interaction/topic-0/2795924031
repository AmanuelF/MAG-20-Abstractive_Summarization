Todayâ€™s vehicles have myriad user interfaces, from those related to the moment-to-moment control of the vehicle, to those that allow the consumption of information and entertainment. The bulk of the work in this domain in the recent past and the present is related to manual driving. In exploring human-machine interaction for manual driving a key issue has been assessing the effects of in-vehicle interfaces on driving safety. Very frequently this is done in the context of an application, such as navigation, entertainment, or communication. With recent advances in automated vehicles, there is an increased attention to user interactions as they relate to creating a place for work and play during a trip. Given that it is unlikely that most vehicles will be fully automated in the near future, there are also significant efforts to understand how to help the driver switch between different modes of automation. This paper provides a review of these areas of research, as well as recommendations for future work.
