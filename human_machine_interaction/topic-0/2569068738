Autonomous vehicles present Human Machine Interaction (HMI) designers and researchers with new challenges. While design decisions are typically based on financial, technical, political and personal reasons, central to novel interfaces for cars of the future is the user. Users are motivated by needs that are rooted in that which gives them meaning. Hence good design results from a process that centers on understanding users and their concerns. Over the course of a tutorial, our team will guide participants on a four-hour crash-course in human-centered design, focusing on HMI for future autonomous vehicles. To encourage interaction, the tutorial is structured around a design thinking lens, where attendees interact through a human-centered design exercise.
