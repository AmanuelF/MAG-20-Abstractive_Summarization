The interaction between drivers and their cars will change significantly with the introduction of autonomous vehicles. The driver's role will shift towards a supervisory control of their autonomous vehicle. The eventual relief from the driving task enables a complete new area of research and practice in human-computer interaction and interaction design. In this one-day workshop, participants will explore the opportunities the design space of autonomous driving will bring to HCI researchers and designers. On the day before workshop participants are invited to visit (together with workshop organizers) Google Partnerplex and Stanford University. At Google participants will have the opportunity to explore Google's autonomous car simulator and might have the chance to experience one of the Google Cars (if available). At Stanford participants are invited to ride in a Wizard-of-Oz autonomous vehicle. Based on this first-hand experience we will discuss design approaches and prototype interaction systems during the next day's workshop. The outcome of this workshop will be a set of concepts, interaction sketches, and low-fidelity paper prototypes that address constraints and potentials of driving in an autonomous car.
