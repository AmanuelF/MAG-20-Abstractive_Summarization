Many automated vehicles are already on our roads, and we can expect that many more will follow soon. Yet, the legal frameworks that govern the deployment and operation of these vehicles are still under development. This paper explores legal issues related to the human-machine interaction for automated vehicles. The paper reviews the current legal landscape, with a focus on the United States, and presents some of the issues that will be of interest to researchers, developers, and regulators as the new legal frameworks take shape.
