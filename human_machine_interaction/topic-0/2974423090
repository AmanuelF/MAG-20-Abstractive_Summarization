The operator directly controls the humanoid robot which is in another space by human's behavior after receiving the scene information of the robot. This control method is more consistent with the practice of the operator, and it makes human's behavior extended in another space. However, it also puts forward higher requirements for the human-machine interaction and the telepresence of the robot system. This paper presents an architecture of human-machine interaction system based on distributed structure. And the delay problem of the network is analyzed under this architecture. In order to conduct human-machine interaction experiment in the laboratory, we designed a set of test methods based on the time-delay simulation principle. The experiment demonstrates that the system has abilities between telepresence and human-machine interaction.
