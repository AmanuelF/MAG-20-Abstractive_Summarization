Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has brought many changes in the way workers operate on and interact with smarter industrial machinery and spaces. New Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) solutions are required as the workersâ€™ demands in the factory are still evolving. This paper introduces the development of a generic model-driven HMI solution that consists of a framework providing an API and widgets that can be (re)used to create the final interfaces for HMI across different I4.0 scenarios. The generic model takes into account the most important aspects of the shop floor context. As a first phase of evaluation, this solution is being tested in a prototype for a real use case, responding to the needs of an industrial partner. The paper ends by presenting this prototype to show the potential of the presented solution.
