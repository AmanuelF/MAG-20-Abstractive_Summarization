Abstract This chapter examines the transition in focus within the human factors engineering domain from the prevention of pain (Ergonomics) to the promotion of pleasure and the use of technology to facilitate well-being (Hedonomics). This transition is framed across technological advancements and their penetration into a wide range of social domains. Implications to human well-being are discussed. Barriers to implementing such hedonic principles are elucidated using examples of emerging areas of research.
