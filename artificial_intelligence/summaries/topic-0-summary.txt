graphsage learns nodes , edges , and their neighbors based on feature information and is flexible enough to perform well on large graph networks that are not currently feasible in existing data sets . graphsage is designed to the first step is to train an adversarial network to learn to translate an image from x to y. for the second step , we introduce a more general neural network to learn to translate an image from a source domain x to a target domain y. we then train the network to translate the image from x to y using the adversarial loss . we then apply the learned translation to the original image . we find that the learning process can be greatly simplified if the input is a binary representation of thethe first step is to train an adversarial network to learn to translate an image from x to y. for the second step , we introduce a more general neural network
