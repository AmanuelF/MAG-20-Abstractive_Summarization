Recent computational neuroscience developments have used deep neural networks to model neural responses in higher visual areas. This Perspective describes key algorithmic underpinnings in computer vision and artificial intelligence that have contributed to this progress and outlines how deep networks could drive future improvements in understanding sensory cortical processing.
