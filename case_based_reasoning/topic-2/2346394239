Artificial intelligence is widely used in identifying human diseases and their treatments. Every day, millions of people get sick and receive treatments. However, there is no system that can accept the information related to the symptoms, diseases, timelines, medical procedures, and medications experienced by various people and use this information to recommend treatments and to predict possible future diseases to other similar people. The purpose of this research is to develop such a system. Case-based reasoning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, is used for this purpose. An algorithm is developed for this purpose. The system has been evaluated to determine its adaptability for change of trend in the field.
