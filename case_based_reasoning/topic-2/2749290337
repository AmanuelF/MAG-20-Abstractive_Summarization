Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) interests the scientific community, whom are concerned with scalability in knowledge representation and processing. CBR systems scale far better than rule-based systems. Rule-based systems are limited by the need to know the rules of engagement, which is practically unobtainable. The work presented in this paper pertains to knowledge generalization based on randomization. Inductive knowledge is inferred through transmutation rules. A domain specific approach is properly formalized to deal with the transmutation rules. Randomized knowledge is validated based on the domain user expertise. The approach is illustrated with an example and is seen to be properly implemented and tested.
