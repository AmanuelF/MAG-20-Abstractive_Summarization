The research of the personalized recommendation system mostly concentrates on how to express, compute and update the interests of users. This article provides the research of personalizing recommendations based on personalized recommendation cases. The case base is the key to Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). To a large extent, the ability of case base to capture and reflect the interests of users determines the degree of personalization of recommendation results from a system. This paper puts forward a construction scheme for a case base of the personalized recommendation system based on CBR. The paper also analyzes the composition and design idea of the case base. It has built a personalized recommendation user case base, a similar user case base, a pattern case base and a knowledge base, which provides rich data for case-based reasoning. Results of the system’s design show that the recommendation case base and data source construction have great significance in the quality of the personalization of the system’s recommendation results.
