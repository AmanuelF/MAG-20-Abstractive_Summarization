This paper presents the design of a Clinician Dashboard to promote co-decision making between patients and clinicians. Targeted patients are those with non-specific low back pain, a leading cause of discomfort, disability and absence from work throughout the world. Targeted clinicians are those in primary care, including general practitioners, physiotherapists, and chiropractors. Here, the functional specifications for the Clinical Dashboard are delineated, and wireframes illustrating the system interface and flow of control are shown. Representative scenarios are presented to exemplify how the system could be used for co-decision making by a patient and clinician. Also included are a discussion of potential barriers to implementation and use in clinical practice and a look ahead to future work. This work has been conducted as part of the Horizon 2020 selfBACK project, which is funded by the European Commission.
