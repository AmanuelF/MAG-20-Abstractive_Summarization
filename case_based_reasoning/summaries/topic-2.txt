the system generates a set of definitions of problems , and compares tems , and compares the resulting definitions with the existing definitions in the literature . the goal is to find the best definitions that satisfy all the constraints of the problem domain , and that are also compatible with other definitions of the same problem . we can use the similarity to determine whether the definitions are compatible , or whether they are at least partially compatible . we then perform a subset - based optimization of in this way , the results of the model - based system can be used to ltem can be used to learn the neural network architecture of the target method .
