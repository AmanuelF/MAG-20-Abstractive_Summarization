The design and implementation of case-based reasoning (CBR) applications is time-consuming. To facilitate the development of CBR applications in various problem domains, the CBR community has created a number of CBR shells and software frameworks in the past twenty years. This paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art of CBR shells and software frameworks, highlights why the integration of Web 2.0 and CBR development tools is useful, and gives an example as to how we implement such integration. We use this example to illustrate how Web 2.0 features such as blogging functions can be integrated in a CBR system. Design recommendations and insights for implementing a Web 2.0-based CBR shell are also provided.
