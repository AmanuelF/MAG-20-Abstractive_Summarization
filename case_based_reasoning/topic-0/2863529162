Furniture layout in a virtual 3D scene is an important and challenging task, as it is time-consuming and requires experience. To address this issue, we propose automatic furniture layout algorithms to help users to rapidly generate reasonable layout results. Specifically, our algorithms divide a scene layout into four layout modes, namely, coupled mode, enclosed mode, matrix mode, and circular mode. Then each model is solved independently. The coupled mode is solved using recursive techniques and case-based reasoning. The enclosed mode is solved using floor field. The distance and angle among the furniture are determined by ergonomics guidelines. Finally, the layout results of the scene can be obtained by combining the solutions from these layout modes, and an evaluation method for the layout results based on user feedback is proposed. For a room with non-rectangular floor, our algorithms can also handle this case using shape standardization techniques. Based on our algorithms, an online 3D furniture layout system is developed. Many experiments are conducted on the system with the real interior design cases, and we compared our algorithms with other popular algorithms. The experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient and can meet the real response requirements of online furniture layout.
