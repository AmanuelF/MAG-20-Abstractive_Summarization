Reagent dosage setting is closely related to the product quality and economic benefit of an iron ore flotation process. The strong nonlinearities, uncertainties and coupling of the flotation process make it difficult to set proper reagent dosage. In this paper, a reagent dosage intelligent optimal setting method based on case-based reasoning (CBR) is put forward. It can calculate the reagent dosage optimal setting value according to ore properties. Result of the industrial experiments conducted in a Chinese iron ore dressing mill shows that the proposed method has a higher computational accuracy and can realize a more stable product quality when compared with other setting methods.
