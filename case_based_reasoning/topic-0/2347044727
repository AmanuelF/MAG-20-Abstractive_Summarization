Brain injury (BI) is recognized as a major health issue. It is common for therapists to include commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games in therapy sessions to help motivate patients who have had a BI to engage in rehabilitation activities. However, we have found that therapists are often frustrated with finding pertinent information about COTS games and systems, which are proliferating at a rapid rate. In this interactive demonstration, we present a web-based prototype 'Choose a Game' tool that is aimed at helping therapists select appropriate games for their patients with BIs that match their therapeutic goals and individual patient attributes. This demonstration is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in areas where technologies are rapidly proliferating for a user group who has wide-ranging attributes.
