In the 2.4m√ó2.4m Transonic Wind Tunnel, dynamic matrix control can effectively improve the control accuracy of wind tunnel flow Mach number. To realize this control method, step response models are generally obtained through step response experiments executed in specific working conditions. A step response experiment requires a lot of time, energy and cost. An estimation method based on case-based reasoning is proposed in this paper, to estimate step response models under a new condition, with existing step response models acquired under different working conditions, and estimated models are applied to dynamic matrix control in wind tunnel. Actual control result verifies the usefulness of the estimated models.
