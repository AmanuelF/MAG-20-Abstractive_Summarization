This paper drives into the deficiencies of the traditional RMA service system of a notebook computer manufacturer and analyzes the customer service behavior of its customer relationship management. It uses a global web-based framework and Java for development tool for the establishment of system. Data compilation procedure, with the help of the pro system case-based deduction technique, provided the system with an automatic analytical capacity, thereby further enhancing the capacity of the web-based intelligent RMA repair and maintenance system. The system allowed an interaction with the customers. The intelligent RMA system allowed us to improve repair and maintenance efficiency by 26%, strongly boosting degree of customer satisfaction. Moreover, the global inventory management can reduce 12%; a boon that not only reduced the interest payments for inventory, but also eased up the company revolving fund cycle. The system can institute a more flexible part supply system, as well as enabled the Quality Assurance (QA) and R&D departments to understand the trouble-causing factors of the products that the company has sold. As a result, product AFR (Annual Failure Rate) dropped by around 85% Finally, we also used the repair and maintenance information to train new engineers. It saved us training time. Hence, the research has designed an innovative and practical IT (CRM) system.
