Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a theoretical approach to understand how narratives support problem-solving. In many game-based learning environments, nonlinear storytelling is a popular approach to unfold the problem-solving experience. For this study, we developed a game-like, case-based learning environment that utilized nonlinear, narrative elements to present cases and facilitate decision-making. The study presented here explored learnersâ€™ general perceptions of the learning environment, with a specific focus on usability. Evaluation results identified themes related to problem representation, perspective taking, decision-making, retention, and retrieval/reuse. Implications for case-based reasoning and educational design research are discussed.
