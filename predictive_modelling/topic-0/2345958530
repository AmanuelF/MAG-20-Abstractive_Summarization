Common diseases have complex aetiology involving the interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors. Here, the authors describe methods for building and evaluating models for the prediction of disease risk based on information from genetic testing and environmental factors, and use case studies to illustrate the potential of such models in the prevention of diseases.
