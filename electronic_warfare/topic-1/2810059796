Metamaterials are subwavelength structure material engineered to have some unique properties that are not found in nature, such as reversed Cherenkov radiation (RCR). Based on the RCR, some important research groups in the world have made great attempts to develop novel metamaterial-inspired vacuum electron devices. These research results clearly show that metamaterial-inspired vacuum electron devices have very remarkable advantages, such as small size, high power, high efficiency, and high gain. These brand new metamaterial-inspired devices have promising applications in radar, communications, electronic warfare, microwave heating, accelerators, imaging, and many other areas.
