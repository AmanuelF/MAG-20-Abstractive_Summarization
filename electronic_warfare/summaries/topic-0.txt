the proposed framework is a cognitive model of the framework 's ew.reu framework 's ew.reusability task , which includes a matrix of latent information about the environments in which the ew is encountered , along with a latent semantic category , a latent spatial category , and a latent temporal category . the latent semantic categories are then used to infer the semantic category of the environment from the latent spatial categories and the temporal categories . the latent semantic categories are then combined to infer the latent semantic category of the environment from
