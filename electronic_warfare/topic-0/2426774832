In Electronic Warfare (EW), environment and scene observations are crucial in determining which Electronic Attack (EA) or Electronic Protection (EP) is most suitable for the current scenario. The time-critical nature of these applications requires decisions to be made quickly. This paper will discuss a framework which utilizes game-theoretic principles in order to provide an autonomous determination of the appropriate EA or EP action to be taken for a given scenario. This process consists of three stages. First, information is gathered about the other emitters in the area. Next, this information is processed and used to compute estimates of the utility and costs of each potential action. Finally, actions are sorted according to effectiveness, based on the expected utility and cost. This paper will provide an example of the framework by illustrating how a non-cooperative game between a radar sensor emitter and an EA radar jammer could be played.
