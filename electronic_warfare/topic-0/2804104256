Graded index (GRIN) optics offer potential for both weight savings and increased performance but have until recently been limited to visible and NIR bands (wavelengths shorter than about 0.9 Âµm). NRL has developed glass-based IR-GRIN lenses compatible with SWIR-LWIR wavebands. Recent designs show the potential for significant SWaP reduction benefits and improved performance using IR-GRIN lens elements in dual-band, MWIR-LWIR sensors. The SWaP and performance advantages of IR-GRIN lenses in platform-relevant dual-band imagers will be presented.
