Applications for space technology, test equipment, electronic warfare systems, and digital radio have made wide-band power amplifiers (WBPAs) the subject of research since 1948 [1], [2]. More recently, the advent of gallium nitride (GaN) technology with its special features, such as wide bandgap, high output power capability, and high electron velocity, has attracted researchers' attention for using such technology in WBPAs [3].
