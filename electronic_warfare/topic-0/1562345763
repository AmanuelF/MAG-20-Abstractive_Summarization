UAVs are divided into two major classes: military and civilian. These classes overlap conceptually, because there are core missions that are common to both the military and civilian world. However, almost all specific UAVs are intended for one or the other market because of the different environments in which they are required to operate. The civilian UAV market is further divided between some commercial and government applications that required relatively large and expensive UAVs and a rapidly growing market for small and inexpensive UAVs that have been applied to an equally rapidly growing list of applications. Classes and missions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are discussed in terms of both various official systems of classification developed by government agencies and informal classifications by size and/or primary markets. These discussions are illustrated by representative examples. Keywords: classes; missions; tier; unmanned aerial system (UAS); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
