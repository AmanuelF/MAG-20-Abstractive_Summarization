There is significant interest in and ongoing development activities related to artificial intelligence. Software systems are now routinely developed and deployed to perform - and make decisions about performing - complicated tasks. Artificial intelligence is being used in systems ranging from search engines to video games to weapon controllers. Cyber and electronic warfare is also in a growth phase and the demand for cyber security professionals is skyrocketing. Even without staffing limitations, humans can't fight a logic war at computers' speed. This paper describes a framework for a system of system for cyber and electronic warfare. This system automatically scans networks, searches for vulnerabilities, exploits these vulnerabilities and utilizes these new hosts as resources for expansion. This system can serve as a countermeasure or deterrent. Alternately, an adversary could develop such a system for offensive purposes. The automated intelligent system described herein is designed to be used to quickly gain control of adversarial infrastructure, which can then be leveraged as necessary.
