Adaptive training (AT) can be an efficient option for providing individualized instruction tailored to trainees’ needs. Given promising research findings involving AT, we were challenged with developing an AT solution for Submarine Electronic Warfare (EW). Submarine EW is a complex task that involves classifying contacts, recognizing changes in the environment, and interpreting real-time displays. To train this task, we designed and developed the Submarine Electronic Warfare Adaptive Trainer (SEW-AT). We drew from multiple theoretical perspectives to drive our design decisions, including Multiple Resource Theory (MRT) and the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Following the trainer’s development, we conducted a training effectiveness evaluation (TEE) to gauge initial performance improvements from SEW-AT. Using Submariners (n = 34) from 4 different Submarine Learning Centers across the United States, we found a 46% reduction in missed reports and a 49% improvement in report accuracy while using SEW-AT. As a next step, we plan to explore how the frequency of adaptation, or adaptation schedules, affect training performance and efficiency to determine if finer-grained adaptations produce greater learning gains.
