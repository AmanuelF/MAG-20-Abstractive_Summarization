This paper presents findings from applying social network analysis tools and techniques to a network of Department of Defense (DoD) systems. The network of systems includes 349 systems that serve as the nodes in the networks and the edges represent shared operational activities. This method captures the versatility of these systems as it identifies systems that can perform the same function for the DoD. Additionally, the visualization of the network enables the identification of potential systems of systems that emerge from the larger network of systems. These systems of systems cluster together around the edge of the overall network and include a logistics, electronic warfare, and force protection system of system. Like most system of systems, these potential groups of system of systems are composed of independent systems, demonstrate emergent behavior, are managed by different services, and interoperate to provide value to the DoD stakeholders. Additionally, these system of systems demonstrate the characteristics of systems of systems from the literature. It appears that applying social network analysis visualization techniques could assist systems engineers in the identification of systems of systems.
