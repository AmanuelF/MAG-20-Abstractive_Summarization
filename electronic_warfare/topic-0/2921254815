This full paper addresses the Innovative Practice Category. We discuss our multidisciplinary approach to create a truly 3D representation and 3D display of RF signals in space through the development of two different training tools to enhance student understanding of Radio Communications. Both tools show the data on 3D autostereoscopic displays rather than rendered back to 2D displays. The first new tool is a series of 3D stereoscopic animations created by a multidisciplinary team of students from the Media Arts and Sciences (School of Informatics) and Electrical Engineering (School of Engineering) programs for use with an autostereoscopic display, where each animation focuses on a single topic within RF communication learning, using real-world examples. The second innovative tool models the Navy use-case of Electronic Warfare (EW) using examples with 3D antenna radiation patterns of signal propagation using U.S. Navy’s SIMDIS interactive 3D visualization environment. The developed scenarios are displayed on an autostereoscopic display, allowing students to manipulate RF signals in a 3D environment. Learning gains were assessed via a 2x2 crossover experimental design an engineering student group. Compared to the control group, students showed gains in understanding of the 3D shape of dipole antennas and understanding of the multiple RF antennas in a cell phone, and the connections between mobile phone antennas and cell towers. The results from these interventions collectively indicate that a truly 3D representation in space can be used to enhance students’ understanding of antennas and RF signals.
