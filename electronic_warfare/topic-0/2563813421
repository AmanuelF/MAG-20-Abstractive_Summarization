this paper provides an overview of research to apply human-machine Situation Awareness (SA) principles to Electronic Warfare (EW). The research leverages the Endsley SA model combined with Cognitive Radio Ontology extensions to provide automatic inference capabilities for EW. The result is an interoperable language for autonomous cognitive EW systems to create and share knowledge about the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) and the platforms using it. In this paper, we explore several modeling and inference constructs using ontologies expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We show that these constructs are aligned with the elements of the Endsley model and when implemented in an autonomous system they can significantly enhance the SA of its users and lead to more informed courses of action.
