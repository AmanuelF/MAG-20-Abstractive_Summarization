Current U.S. Navy ships employ multiple federated Radio Frequency (RF) apertures to perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), Communication (Comms), Signals collection, and Information Operations (IO) functions. Historically, each function (and hence system) has its own aperture, electronics, operators, and logistics/maintenance infrastructure. This approach results in systems competing for limited space and optimum placement and results in an inefficient use of resources and Electro Magnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) problems. To improve the performance of RF systems the Office of Naval Research (ONR) developed technologies through the Integrated Topside (InTop) program that provide control of the electromagnetic spectrum through adaptive wide band apertures & signal processing to maximize war fighting capability. Several innovative approaches in RF system design and wide band apertures were developed to reduce cost and improve performance. In addition, InTop uses an open RF architecture (hardware & software) that is scalable to meet multiple platform needs and facilitate best of breed technology, competition and cost effective upgrades for apertures and electronics throughout the life cycle of the ship.
