this method is based on a novel alternating direction method ( adm ) tion method ( adm ) that is based on the use of a nonnegative latent factor . in this paper , we propose a new method for increasing the efficiency of the nonnegative latent factor model for large scale sparse matrices in recommender systems via alternating direction method . this method is based on a novel
