In this paper, an online power system transient stability assessment (TSA) problem is mapped as a two-class classification problem and a novel data mining algorithm the core vector machine (CVM) is proposed to solve the problem based on phasor measurement units (PMUs) big data. First of all, an offline training, online application framework is proposed, which contained four sub-steps, namely features selection, offline training, online application, and assessment evaluation. First, 24 features are selected to present the system status. Then in the offline training procedure, the PMU big data is generated by time domain simulation, and a CVM model is trained and tested. In the online application procedure, an interface between PMU data center and feature calculation program is set up to collect real time specific PMU big data and the CVM trained is applied to the TSA problem. Last but not least, the evaluation indices are calculated. Compared with other support vector machines, the proposed CVM based assessment algorithm has the higher precision, meanwhile, it has the least time consumption and space complexity. As long as online PMU big data are received, TSA can be done simultaneously. Case studies on the IEEE New England 39-bus system, and real systems in China and the U.S., exhibit the speed and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
