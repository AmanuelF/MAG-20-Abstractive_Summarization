A wireless wearable high data throughput (big data) brain machine interface apparatus is presented. An implanted recording and transmitting module collects neural data from a plurality of implanted electrodes and wirelessly transmits this over a short distance to a wearable (not implanted) receiving and forwarding module, which communicates the data over a wired communication to a mobile post processing device. The post processing device can send this neural data to an external display or computer enabled device for viewing and/or manipulation. High data throughput is supported by aggregating multiple groups of electrodes by multiple n-channel recording elements, which are multiplexed and then modulated into high frequency wireless communications to the wearable module. Embodiments include use of multiple radiators (multiple polarizations and/or spatially distributed), with beam alignment adjustment.
