The fifth generation (5G) mobile communication networks will require a major paradigm shift to satisfy the increasing demand for higher data rates, lower network latencies, better energy efficiency, and reliable ubiquitous connectivity. With prediction of the advent of 5G systems in the near future, many efforts and revolutionary ideas have been proposed and explored around the world. The major technological breakthroughs that will bring renaissance to wireless communication networks include (1) a wireless software-defined network, (2) network function virtualization, (3) millimeter wave spectrum, (4) massive MIMO, (5) network ultra-densification, (6) big data and mobile cloud computing, (7) scalable Internet of Things, (8) device-to-device connectivity with high mobility, (9) green communications, and (10) new radio access techniques. In this paper, the state-of-the-art and the potentials of these ten enabling technologies are extensively surveyed. Furthermore, the challenges and limitations for each technology are treated in depth, while the possible solutions are highlighted.
