In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, companies are facing challenges in dealing with big data issues for rapid decision making for improved productivity. Many manufacturing systems are not ready to manage big data due to the lack of smart analytics tools. U.S. has been driving the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Industrial Internet to advance future manufacturing. Germany is leading a transformation toward 4th Generation Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) based on Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS). It is clear that as more predictive analytics software and embedded IoT are integrated in industrial products and systems, predictive technologies can further intertwine intelligent algorithms with electronics and tether-free intelligence to predict product performance degradation and autonomously manage and optimize product service needs. The book chapter will address the trends of predictive big data analytics and CPS for future industrial TES systems. First, industrial big data issues in TES will be addressed. Second, predictive analytics and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) enabled product manufacturing and services will be introduced. Third, advanced predictive analytics technologies for smart maintenance and TES with case studies will be presented. Finally, future trends of digital twin industrial systems will be presented.
