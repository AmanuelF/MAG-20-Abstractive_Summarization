Objectives: Improving the accuracy and precision of predictive crime analytics necessitates a good understanding of the how exogenous variables, such as weather and holidays, impact crime.Methods: We examine 5.7 million reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago between 2001 to 2014. This data set is among the largest yet studied when assessing factors that may impact temporal trends in crime. Using linear regression methods, we examine the temporal relationship of the crime incidents to weather, holidays, school vacations, day-of-week, and paydays. We employ bootstrap methods for model selection to help address the problem of multicollinearity among potential explanatory variables. Importantly for the aspect of predictive analytics, we validate the predictive capabilities of our model on an independent data set.Results: We find significant dependence of crime on time of year, holidays, and weekdays. We find that dependence of aggressive crime on temperature depends on the hour of the day, and whether it takes place outside or inside. In addition, unusually hot/cold days are associated with unusual fluctuations upwards/downwards in crimes of aggression, respectively, regardless of the time of year.Conclusions: We find that including forecasts for temperature in predictive crime analytics software may significantly improve short term crime forecasts for many types of crime, particularly aggressive crime.
