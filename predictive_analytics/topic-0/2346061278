Abstract Cyber manufacturing is transformative concept that involves the translation of data from interconnected systems into predictive and prescriptive operations to achieve resilient performance. It intertwines industrial big data and smart analytics to discover and comprehend invisible issues for decision making. With the advent of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and smart, predictive analytics technologies, companies have been building a networked data-rich environment, which calls for a systematic methodology to transform raw data into meaningful and actionable operations. This paper introduces a fundamental framework and architecture for cyber manufacturing systems.
