A combination of big data and predictive analytics orchestrated through the Internet of Things (IoT) offers many opportunities for researchers in Information Systems, Operations Management and Strategy to look at old problems in new ways, and to identify completely new research areas. While there is much hype, little research has been conducted that informs companies about how to profitably integrate the IoT with strategic or operational processes. This paper views the IoT through the lens of predictive maintenance -- the use of real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to dynamically manage preventive maintenance policies. These are being used by numerous manufacturing organizations to transition from product-oriented to service-oriented business models. In particular, we analyze optimal preventive maintenance policies in an environment where equipment is subject to a deterioration, which shifts it from its initial, fully-productive state, having a specified, age-dependent failure rate to a less-productive or deteriorated state, having a different, presumably higher, age-dependent failure rate. The deterioration, itself, is a random process.
