ABSTRACTGiven the increased interest and investment in business analytics (BA) applications, it is important to have an understanding of what analytics capabilities firms use to enhance value through their value chain activities. We illustrate exemplar uses of BA applications, tools, and technologies by presenting a mapping of the (BA) capabilities of a firm from a value chain perspective espoused in Porter’s [52] internet capabilities framework. The mapping of BA capabilities was carried out based on the generally accepted classification of analytics – descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. The study uses both secondary and primary data sets. Results suggest that organizations currently focus on application of analytics where outcomes are easily measurable in terms of direct value creation/addition.
