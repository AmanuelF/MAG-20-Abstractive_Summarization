Abstract New technologies in safety-critical systems offer the promise of next generation system features and capabilities; predictive analytics; enhanced and remote monitoring; and perhaps improved operator performance. At the same time, however, questions arise about the impact of such technologies on system safety, operator performance, and decision processes, in settings where safe and effective performance are of paramount importance. Wearable, immersive augmented reality (WIAR) technology is one such technology whose introduction sparks these questions. Despite the proliferation of WIAR technology in safety-critical settings, few studies have examined its impacts on operator performance, decision processes and situation awareness in these settings. As a result, this paper considers research needs for evaluating WIAR technology in safety-critical systems. To illustrate the research needed, we consider the use case of a WIAR technology in marine navigation, and propose a research framework, summarizing research needs and identifying needed next steps.
