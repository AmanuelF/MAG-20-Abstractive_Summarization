Abstract Machine learning applied to electronic health records (EHRs) can generate actionable insights, from improving upon patient risk score systems, to predicting the onset of disease, to streamlining hospital operations. Statistical models that leverage the variety and richness of EHR-derived data are still relatively rare and offer an exciting avenue for further research. In this chapter, we present an overview of how machine learning has been applied in clinical settings and summarize the advantages it offers over traditional analysis methods. We describe the methodological and operational challenges of using machine learning in research and practice. Lastly, we offer our perspective on future application areas for machine learning that will significantly impact health and healthcare delivery.
