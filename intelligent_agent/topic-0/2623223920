Knowledge Management (KM) is emerging as one of the management tools to gain competitive advantage and e-businesses are beginning to invest in KM initiatives. Though several organizations have reported successful KM projects, there are many failures due to a variety of reasons including the incongruence between strategic and KM objectives, as well as lack of a framework for supporting KM related activities. This paper presents a framework for knowledge management, which takes into account the different levels of knowledge that exist within e-businesses. The architecture of a KM system that incorporates enabling technologies such as intelligent agents and XML is also discussed.
