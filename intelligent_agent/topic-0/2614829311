Abstract Cognitive architectures serve as both unified theories of the mind and as computational infrastructures for constructing intelligent agents. In this article, we review the evolution of one such framework, I carus , over the three decades of its development. We discuss the representational and processing assumptions made by different versions of the architecture, their relation to alternative theories, and some promising directions for future research.
