Abstract The future of artificial intelligence (AI) depends on whether intelligent agents become human-like in their cognitive capabilities, giving rise to creative Cobots and social Actors that will inherit human values and get accepted by the society as equal minds. This expected transition requires the development of several key capabilities in AI, including social-emotional and narrative intelligence, resulting in believability and trustworthiness, and also human-like learnability and creativity. This work is devoted to the key element that enables social-emotional intelligence in artifacts: the semantic map. For this purpose, the notion of semantic mapping is expanded, and its role in a socially-emotional cognitive architecture is articulated, with illustrations by several examples of Cobot and Actor designs. The approach based on the previously introduced cognitive architecture eBICA is selected, that considers feelings and reasoning as connected to each other. The two aspects are intimately intertwined in one dynamical system framework, forming a general-purpose cognitive architecture, the central element of which is a semantic map. Results of preliminary studies along these lines together illustrate the breadth of the variety of potential applications of the new technology.
