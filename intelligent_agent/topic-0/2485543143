This paper discusses two studies testing the effects of agent transparency in joint cognitive systems involving supervisory control and decision-making. Specifically, we examine the impact of agent transparency on operator performance (decision accuracy), response time, perceived workload, perceived usability of the agent, and operator trust in the agent. Transparency has a positive impact on operator performance, usability, and trust, yet the depiction of uncertainty has potentially negative effects on usability and trust. Guidelines and considerations for displaying transparency in joint cognitive systems are discussed.
