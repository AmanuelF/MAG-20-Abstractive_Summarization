We developed the user interfaces for two Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) tasking environments: dismounted infantry interacting with a ground robot (Autonomous Squad Member) and human interaction with an intelligent agent to manage a team of heterogeneous robotic vehicles (IMPACT). These user interfaces were developed based on the Situation awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) model. User testing showed that as agent transparency increased, so did overall human-agent team performance. Participants were able to calibrate their trust in the agent more appropriately as agent transparency increased.
