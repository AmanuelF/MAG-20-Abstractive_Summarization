In picoscopic modeling, drivers are modeled as an intelligent agent who is able to gather information from his or her driving environment and make a decision to achieve his or her goalsâ€”for example, traveling to the destination on the preferred route at the desired speed while avoiding hazards. The outputs of the driver model are driving decisions, including steering, accelerating, and braking, which, in turn, can be represented by acceleration in the longitudinal and lateral directions. To serve this purpose, this chapter introduces a generic modeling approach, called the field theory of traffic flow, that represents everything in the environment as a field perceived by the subject driver whose mission is to achieve his or her goals by navigating through the overall field.
