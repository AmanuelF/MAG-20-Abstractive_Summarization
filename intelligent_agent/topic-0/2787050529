Purpose This paper aims to empirically investigate the influence of the intelligent agent technology (IAT) on hotels’ food procurement practices (FPPRs) and food procurement performance (FPP). The study also explores the influence of FPPR on FPP in hotels. Design/methodology/approach Data from a survey of managers at luxury hotels in Florida, which yielded an effective sample of 78, were subjected to partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis. Findings IAT usage has statistically significant positive effect on both FPPR and FPP. Additionally, the results indicated that PPR has a positive influence on FPP. Research limitations/implications The study provided academia with a comprehensive review of the prior research on IAT benefits in food supply chain management (FSCM) and a comprehensive explanation of how the hotel FPPR are being performed by IAT. It also offers industry and technology specific insights. Practical implications Hotel managers should pay more attention to IAT application regarding the FPPR, specifically gathering information, supplier contract, contacting, requisitioning and intelligence and analysis. Moreover, hotel managers should enhance their employees’ abilities to be technology-oriented to maximize IAT benefits in FPP. Originality/value The results represent an extension to the technological innovation literature of the hospitality industry to bridge the gap of IAT in hotel FP. The framework used in the study serves as a foundation for future research studies in the hospitality industry, in FSCM in particular.
