People usually interact with intelligent agents (IAs) when they have certain goals to be accomplished. Sometimes these goals are complex and may require interacting with multiple applications, which may focus on different domains. Current IAs may be of limited use in such cases and the user needs to directly manage the task at hand. An ideal personal agent would be able to learn, over time, these tasks spanning different resources. In this article, we address the problem of cross-domain task assistance in the context of spoken dialog systems, and describe our approach about discovering such tasks and how IAs learn to talk to users about the task being carried out. Specifically we investigate how to learn user activity patterns in a smartphone environment that span multiple apps and how to incorporate usersâ€™ descriptions about their high-level intents into human-agent interaction.
