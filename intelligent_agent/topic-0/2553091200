From television to computers to new mobile touchscreen devices, children’s social interactions and relationships are increasingly embedded in media. This chapter will summarize how children learn from screens, emphasizing the importance of social factors in their learning. We argue here that the one-sided, emotionally tinged relationships that children form with media characters, known as parasocial relationships, influence children’s acquisition of information presented on screens. More specifically, these parasocial relationships can be instrumental in aiding children in their understanding of concepts that are essential for success in school, including language learning and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topic areas. We then turn to future research directions in which we highlight robots and intelligent agents as technologies that will increasingly blur the lines between what is real and what is not. The implication is that social influences that occur through real people also apply to children’s learning from favorite media characters, providing an important avenue for teaching essential educational concepts in twenty-first century homes and classrooms across numerous media platforms.
