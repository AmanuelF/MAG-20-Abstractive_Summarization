In 1960, JCR Licklider forecast three phases for how humans relate to machines: human-computer interaction, human-computer symbiosis, and ultra-intelligent machines. Have we moved from interaction to symbiosis or integration, should we focus on this or on other aspects of human augmentation via powerful tools, and how will such decisions affect us as designers, researchers, and members of society? This panel will raise uneasy and disruptive HCI notions. For example, we will debate whether integration is a necessary and desirable next phase, or whether it could undermine human self-efficacy and control and lessen the predictability of machine actions.
