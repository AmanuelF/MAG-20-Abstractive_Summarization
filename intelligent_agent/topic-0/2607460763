In this article, previous literature on the intelligent tire has been reviewed, especially focusing on the estimation of tire characteristics such as tire forces and contact patch characteristics of a loaded rolling tire. The contact patch features and the global deformation of tire are identified as the key factors for the tire force estimation. In this review article, the measurement values to characterize these estimation parameters and the corresponding sensors are investigated. The estimated tire features and associated algorithms are presented based on the type of measurements. It is revealed that numerous dynamic features including wheel forces, slippage in contact, contact length on dry and wet roads, and hydroplaning can be identified by using the intelligent tire system. From this review, the authors of this article suggest that intelligent tire can be exploited to analyze the tire characteristics themselves besides the application for the advanced vehicle control. However, for the purpose of tire characteristic analysis, the well-established physical concepts must be employed into the estimation process. This review article is expected to provide resources to researchers or developers who are interested in the advanced vehicle controls integrated with intelligent tire system, and who want to utilize the intelligent tire for the purpose of tire performance analysis as well.
