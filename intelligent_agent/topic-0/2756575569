ABSTRACTThe rise in popularity of devices such as Alexa and Google Home has brought more attention to artificial intelligence and its capabilities. Intelligent agents, a form of artificial intelligence, started as having the ability to run commands and have since evolved into much more complex devices with sophisticated software that offers a wide range of uses and integration with other services. Understanding what intelligent agents are, and their uses, is important for libraries in order to keep up with the ever-changing technology landscape.
