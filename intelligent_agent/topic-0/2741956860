The recent years several companies have invested a lot of money on autonomous cars. This is a part of the future, where autonomous cars (i.e. smart—⊠cars) will transport us to different places without drivers in a nearly optimum way. It should be noted that we are not ready yet, although companies promote their autonomous cars with 80% reliable performance. Thus in this paper, we present a smart car model based on intelligent agents for reducing accident using a more safe approach. The approach is based on existing traffic rules and by training the smart cars on human drivers'safe behavior.
