Communication of the inner workings of an intelligent agent, or agent transparency, is important for human operators' calibration of their trust in the agent. Recent work has focused on methods of communicating this information in the context of agent-assisted mission planning. This investigation looked at the framing of agent communication and how it might interact with level of agent transparency. Results showed that critical framing improved operator's perception and trust of the agent regardless of the agent's transparency level. Further, findings suggest that the effects of framing are especially pronounced in low transparency applications.
