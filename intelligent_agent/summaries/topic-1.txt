we apply dbl to search and optimization problems in which the concentrn which the concentration of a parameter in a matrix is a criterion of success or failure in an optimization problem . we show that the dbl framework is flexible enough to handle different kinds of diversification and diversification based learning problems . n which the concentration of a parameter in a matrix is a criterion of success or failure in an optimization problem . we show that the dbl framework is flexible enough to handle different
