Abstract This paper proposes a data fusion technique aimed at achieving highly accurate localization in a wireless sensor network with low computational cost. This is accomplished by fusing multiple types of sensor measurement data including received signal strength and angle of arrival. The proposed method incorporates a powerful data fusion technique, one that has never before been used in low cost localization of a stationary node, known as Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory. Many useful functions of this theory, including sampling, aggregation, and plausibility, are integrated into the localization method. From there, the algorithm determines whether a set of given measurements belong to a particular county. Motivated by the flexible nature of Dempster-Shafer Theory, a multitude of network setups and combinations of available measurement features are tested to verify the performance of the proposed method. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained from extensive simulations. When compared with the results of existing approaches in similarly constructed scenarios, the proposed localization technique achieves up to 98% accuracy in less than a tenth of the run-time required under presently established algorithms.
