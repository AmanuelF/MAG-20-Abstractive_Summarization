Abstract Reliable recognition of fault type and assessment of fault severity is essential for decision making in condition-based maintenance of gear transmission systems. In engineering practice, the gear systems are often subject to hybrid faults on the same component or different components. The concurrence of multiple faults makes the fault detection, in particular, the examination of both the fault types and severities, more challenging. Recently, this research area has been recognized as an important direction. A logic solution is to decouple the hybrid faults. This paper reviews various aspects of recent research in decoupling diagnosis of hybrid faults in gear transmission systems, and discusses the techniques used for gearbox hybrid faults decoupling. The general fault detection technologies for gearboxes are also briefly summarized. A potential methodology based on the bounded component analysis (BCA) for hybrid faults decoupling is discussed. Possible future research trends of gearbox hybrid faults decoupling diagnosis are suggested.
