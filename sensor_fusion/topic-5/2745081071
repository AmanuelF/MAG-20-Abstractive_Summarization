Goddardâ€™s LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), hyperspectral and thermal (G-LiHT) airborne imager is a new system to advance concepts of data fusion for worldwide applications. A recent G-LiHT mission conducted in June 2016 over an urban area opens a new opportunity to assess the G-LiHT products for urban land-cover mapping. In this study, the G-LiHT hyperspectral and LiDAR-canopy height model (LiDAR-CHM) products were evaluated to map five broad land-cover types. A feature/decision-level fusion strategy was developed to integrate two products. Contemporary data processing techniques were applied, including object-based image analysis, machine-learning algorithms, and ensemble analysis. Evaluation focused on the capability of G-LiHT hyperspectral products compared with multispectral data with similar spatial resolution, the contribution of LiDAR-CHM, and the potential of ensemble analysis in land-cover mapping. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the application of the G-Li...
