We present a real-time system that enables a highly capable dynamic quadruped robot to maintain an accurate six-degree-of-freedom pose estimate within a 1.0% error of distance traveled over long distances traversed through complex, dynamic outdoor terrain, during day and night, in the presence of camera occlusion and saturation, and occasional large external disturbances, such as slips or falls. The system fuses a stereo-camera sensor, inertial measurement unit, leg odometry, and optional intermittent GPS position updates with an extended Kalman filter to ensure robust, low-latency performance. To maintain a six-degree-of-freedom local positioning accuracy alongside the global positioning knowledge, two reference frames are used; a local reference frame and a global reference frame, with the former benefiting obstacle detection and mapping and the latter for operator-specified and autonomous way-point following. Extensive experimental results obtained from multiple field tests are presented to illustrate the performance and robustness of the system over hours of continuous runs and hundreds of kilometers of distance traveled in a wide variety of terrains and conditions.
