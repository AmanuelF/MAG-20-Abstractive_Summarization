Abstract Data fusion in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks for different data types coming from different sources is the foundation for decision making in the smart vehicle driving systems. Different communication technologies have been combined to form a heterogeneous V2X network to support the data exchange. However, data fusion trust models are still designed for single use cases which cannot meet the general needs of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). In this paper, we first define a data fusion trust architecture with different trust levels. Then, we propose an efficient and practical data fusion trust system for the multi-source and multi-formats of data exchange in the V2X heterogeneous networks. In particular, a location-based PKI system with acceleration brought by General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) is presented for efficient key distribution with a high level of trust achieved. A performance evaluation is given to verify our data fusion trust system can meet the strict latency requirements in V2X networks.
