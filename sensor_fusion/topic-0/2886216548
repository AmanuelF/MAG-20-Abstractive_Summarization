Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) have become a salient feature for safety in modern vehicles. They are also a key underlying technology in emerging autonomous vehicles. State-of-the-art ADASs are primarily vision based, but light detection and ranging (lidar), radio detection and ranging (radar), and other advanced-sensing technologies are also becoming popular. In this article, we present a survey of different hardware and software ADAS technologies and their capabilities and limitations. We discuss approaches used for vision-based recognition and sensor fusion in ADAS solutions. We also highlight challenges for the next generation of ADASs.
