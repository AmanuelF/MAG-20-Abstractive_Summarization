Artificial Neural Networks have dramatically improved performance for many machine learning tasks. We demonstrate a new architecture for a fully optical neural network that enables a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude and three orders of magnitude in power efficiency over state-of-the-art electronics.
