in the article , researchers from the university of texas at austin and the university of toronto show that the model accuracy and resource utilisation of a popular deep neural network ( dnn ) is significantly higher than previously thought . in the paper , the researchers use the mxnet ( machine learning model for neural network ) to train a dnn on real - world images and analyse the performance of the model against some real - world benchmarks .
