the current state of the art is to use the finite element methods to generate points , however this has some drawbacks . first , it is computationally expensive and is difficult to model and control the transformations that occur . second , the point set generation method is limited to the number of points that can be represented in the output image , and it is not possible to generate points that are not within the input image . third , the point set generation method has a number of disadvantages that can be we present a novel approach
