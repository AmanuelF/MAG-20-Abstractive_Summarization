the model first computes a set of mean and variance parameters , whiche parameters , which are then used to obtain the covariance matrix and the autoregressive prediction error . the model is then applied to the training set to obtain the final predicted value . the model also provides the possibility of generating the final prediction using the previous model and the current model . the final prediction is obtained by applying the autoregressive prediction error to the final values of the two models . the final prediction is then validated by applying the aut
