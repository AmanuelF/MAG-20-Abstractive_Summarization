in addition to the cost of training the hidden state , training the hiin addition to the cost of training the hidden state , training the hidden state can require hundreds of thousands of samples per hidden state . these samples are typically generated by the application of a large number of hidden units , which are then trained to perform a variety of tasks . as a result , the training time for a deep visuomotor policy is typically on the order of hours . the training of the network learns a mapping from the images of a single
