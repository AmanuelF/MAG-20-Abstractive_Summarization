Since the initial recognition that human knowledge is structured in a relational manner, technologies have been developed for assessing and analyzing the structure of knowledge for a variety of purposes. A computer-based text analytic offline software system, ALA-Reader, that was developed to assess this knowledge structure (KS) reflected in a text has been modified and improved since its initial announcement (Clariana 2004) through a number of investigations in various kinds of learning environments across several languages. Based on the empirical evidence from the ALA-Reader, we have recently developed the online version of the ALA-Reader, called Graphical Interface of Knowledge Structure (GIKS), that can immediately convert studentsâ€™ writings into visually represented KS network graphs to indicate specific areas of their knowledge strengths and weaknesses compared to the referent KS (e.g., a teacher), regardless of which language is used. This paper presents an overview of the ALA-Reader system and applications, as well as the implication of the GIKS system in online contexts.
