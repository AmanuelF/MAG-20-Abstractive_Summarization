The increasing complexity of IT environments dictates the usage of intelligent automation driven by cognitive technologies, aiming at providing higher quality and more complex services. Inspired by cognitive computing, an integrated framework is proposed for a problem resolution. In order to improve the efficiency of the problem resolution process, it is crucial to formalize problem records and discover relationships between elements of the records, records overall and other technical information. In the proposed framework, the domain knowledge is modeled using ontology. The key contribution of the framework is a novel domain specific approach for extracting useful phrases, that enables an automation improvement through resolution recommendation utilizing the ontology modeling technique. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are evaluated by an extensive empirical study of a large scale real ticket data.
