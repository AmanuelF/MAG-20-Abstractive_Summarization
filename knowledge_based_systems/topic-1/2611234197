With the rapid digitalization of the health sector, people often turn to mobile apps and online health websites for health advice. Health advice generated from different sources can be conflicting as they address different aspects of health (e.g., weight loss, diet, disease) or as they are unaware of the context of a user (e.g., age, gender, physiological condition). Conflicts can occur due to lexical features, (such as, negation, antonyms, or numerical mismatch) or can be conditioned upon time and/or physiological status. We formulate the problem of finding conflicting health advice and develop a comprehensive taxonomy of conflicts. While a similar research area in the natural language processing domain explores the problem of textual contradiction identification, finding conflicts in health advice poses its own unique lexical and semantic challenges. These include large structural variation between text and hypothesis pairs, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, and inference of the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why and how). Hence, we develop Preclude, a novel semantic rule-based solution to detect conflicting health advice derived from heterogeneous sources utilizing linguistic rules and external knowledge bases. As our solution is interpretable and comprehensive, it can guide users towards conflict resolution too. We evaluate Preclude using 1156 real advice statements covering 8 important health topics that are collected from smart phone health apps and popular health websites. Preclude results in 90% accuracy and outperforms the accuracy and F1 score of the baseline approach by about 1.5 times and 3 times, respectively.
