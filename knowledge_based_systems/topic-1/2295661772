A high-functioning Learning Health System requires extraordinary knowledge management and a profound capacity to formulate health advice. To meet these requirements, existing digital libraries of static narrative documents will have to give way to repositories of biomedical knowledge represented in more transactional forms. This paper introduces Digital Knowledge Objects (DKOs) and DKO clusters. These two "unit holdings" within a new sort of digital knowledge repository permit serializing, managing, and disseminating many types of knowledge, and afford a means of formulating individualized health advice automatically using stored digital knowledge.
