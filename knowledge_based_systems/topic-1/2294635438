Defining when a knowledge management (KM) project or initiative is successful is difficult. Jennex, Smolnik, and Croasdell propose that KM success is measured in four dimensions: impact on business processes, impact on KM strategy, leadership/management support, and knowledge content [20], [21]. This study proposes a set of measures that operationalizes these four dimensions. A survey explores the extent to which these measures are observed in specific KM projects or initiatives. Results from the survey identify 20 items indicating KM success and provides evidence that the KM success dimensions are significant.
