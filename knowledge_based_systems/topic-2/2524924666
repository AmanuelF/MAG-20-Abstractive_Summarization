The purpose of this quantitative study is to investigate the factors influencing with the Knowledge Management (KM) use process in Information Technology (IT) enterprises in the Southern United States. This study aims to present an analysis of the use of information systems by IT managers, IT supervisors, and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) from several information technology enterprises. It utilizes the theoretical Knowledge Management Successful model developed by Kulkarni, Ravindran, and Freeze (2007)39, which investigated the use of Information Systems (IS) for successful KM practices in organizations through the examination of available knowledge systems built to the use and reuse of information, content quality, and determinants of users perceptions of usefulness, user satisfaction and organizational support structure for knowledge management. In this study the data was collected from a sample size of 166 individuals, per G*Power 3 statistical power analysis program, to determine the sample and effect between the 8 (eight) predictors variables for estimating change among scores depicting Knowledge Use. Statistical analysis used SPSS package to test the hypothesis. The relationships between the predictor and criterion variables were evaluated using simultaneous multiple regression modelling to support inferences related to the omnibus research questions. The 8 (eight) predictors variables (Explicit Knowledge, Knowledge Systems, Supervisor, Co-Worker, Leadership, Incentive, Perceived Usefulness, and User Satisfaction) in this model were regressed independently onto scores on the Knowledge Use scale. This study concludes that the model predicting knowledge use is both statistically significant and practically significant, and that scores associated with Explicit Knowledge, Leadership, Perceived Usefulness, and User Satisfaction yielded statistically strong predictive relationships.
