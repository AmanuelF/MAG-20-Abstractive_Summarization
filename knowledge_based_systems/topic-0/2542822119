AbstractScience and technology innovation has always depended on organizational innovation. But the complexity of many innovation systems now transforms the nature of this interdependence. The essay proposes a framework of organizing for twenty-first-century complex innovation systems that capture their emergent, situated, and integral nature. The framework disentangles the complex system into four distinct yet interdependent problems that must be set and solved (project, knowledge systems, strategy, and ecological connections). New research thrusts within and among the four problems are proposed.
