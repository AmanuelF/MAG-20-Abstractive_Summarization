Stabilizing the angle while controlling the wheel position in single wheel inverted pendulum systems has always been a challenge for control engineers. The current paper presents a novel hierarchically optimized fuzzy controller to overcome this confrontation. The overall strategy of choosing between conflicting linguistic rules and determination of the knowledge-based of the system is discussed and explained in detail. A fuzzy controller is then designed which is optimized in two steps: At the first, genetic algorithm is used in the integer programming mode to partially optimize the knowledge-based of the system; In the second stage, the designed controller is optimized for performance enhancement. Simulation results ensure the stability and performance of the proposed optimal fuzzy controller.
