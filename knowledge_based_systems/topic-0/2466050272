In recent years, transportation electrification has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged, plug-in electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control functionality, such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations and control. The hybrid dynamic system model is composed of a marked Petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The model is demonstrated on an illustrative example of moderate size and functional heterogeneity.
