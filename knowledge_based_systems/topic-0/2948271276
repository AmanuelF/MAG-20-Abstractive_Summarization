After entering the big data era, a new term of ‘big knowledge’ has been coined to deal with challenges in mining a mass of knowledge from big data. While researchers used to explore the basic characteristics of big data, we have not seen any studies on the general and essential properties of big knowledge. To fill this gap, this paper studies the concepts of big knowledge, big-knowledge system, and big-knowledge engineering. Ten massiveness characteristics for big knowledge and big-knowledge systems, including massive concepts, connectedness, clean data resources, cases, confidence, capabilities, cumulativeness, concerns, consistency, and completeness, are defined and explored. Based on these characteristics, a comprehensive investigation is conducted on some large-scale knowledge engineering projects, including the Fifth Comprehensive Traffic Survey in Shanghai, the China's Xia-Shang-Zhou Chronology Project, the Troy and Trojan War Project, and the International Human Genome Project, as well as the online free encyclopedia Wikipedia. We also investigate the recent research efforts on knowledge graphs, where they are analyzed to determine which ones can be considered as big knowledge and big-knowledge systems. Further, a definition of big-knowledge engineering and its life cycle paradigm is presented. All of these projects are accordingly checked to determine whether they belong to big-knowledge engineering projects. Finally, the perspectives of big knowledge research are discussed.
