In this paper we investigate the finite-time synchronization for second-order multi-agent system via pinning exponent sliding mode control. Firstly, for the nonlinear multi-agent system, differential mean value theorem is employed to transfer the nonlinear system into linear system, then, by pinning only one node in the system with novel exponent sliding mode control, we can achieve synchronization in finite time. Secondly, considering the 3-DOF helicopter system with nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, the novel exponent sliding mode control protocol is applied to only one node to achieve the synchronization. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed method.
