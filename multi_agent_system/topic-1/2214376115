This paper is devoted to fault detection (FD) for high-order multi-agent systems with disturbances. In order to detect the fault occurred in one agent, the unknown input observer (UIO) is constructed in its neighbor. Two cases are considered, if the perfect UI decoupling condition is satisfied, the UI does not affect the residual; if the condition is not satisfied, this paper proposes a method of partitioning the UI into two parts, such that a subset of the UI does not appear in residual dynamics, and the influence of the other UI is constrained. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
