SUMMARY This paper investigates the problem of distributed reliable H∞ consensus control for high-order networked agent systems with actuator faults and switching undirected topologies. The Lipschitz nonlinearities, several types of actuator faults, and exogenous disturbances are considered in subsystems. Suppose the communication network of the multi-agent systems may switch among finite connected graphs. By utilizing the relative state information of neighbors, a new distributed adaptive reliable consensus protocol is presented for actuator failure compensations in individual nodes. Note that the Lyapunov function for error systems may not decrease as the communication network is time-varying; as a result, the existing distributed adaptive control technique cannot be applied directly. To overcome this difficulty, the topology-based average dwell time approach is introduced to deal with switching jumps. By applying topology-based average dwell time approach and Lyapunov theory, the distributed controller design condition is given in terms of LMIs. It is shown that the proposed scheme can guarantee that the reliable H∞ consensus problem is solvable in the presence actuator faults and external disturbance. Finally, two numerical examples are given the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
