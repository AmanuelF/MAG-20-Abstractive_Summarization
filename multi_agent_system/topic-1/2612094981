This paper proposes a fault localization, isolation and restoration method for microgrids based on multiagent system (MAS) utilizing a communication network. The agents are located in the middle and the two ends of each section. The fault is detected through phase angle comparison of current signals at both sides of the distribution line and sends the trip signal to circuit breakers. This technique does not require voltage transformers or relays and does not transfer the data for long distances between agents to decrease the delay time for isolating the fault. We also performed power restoration process following fault clearance considering voltage, frequency and power flow constraints in the microgrid. Simulation studies were performed to validate the proposed protection scheme.
