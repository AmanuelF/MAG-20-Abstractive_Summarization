In this paper, we present a new prescribed-time distributed control method for consensus and containment of networked multiple systems. Different from both regular finite-time control (where the finite settling time is not uniform in initial conditions) and the fixed-time control (where the settling time cannot be preassigned arbitrarily), the proposed one is built upon a novel scaling function, resulting in prespecifiable convergence time (the settling time can be preassigned as needed within any physically allowable range). Furthermore, the developed control scheme not only ensures that all the agents reach the average consensus in prescribed finite time under undirected connected topology, but also ensures that all the agents reach a prescribed-time consensus with the rootâ€™s state being the group decision value under the directed topology containing a spanning tree with the root as the leader. In addition, we extend the result to prescribed-time containment control involving multiple leaders under directed communication topology. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed control.
