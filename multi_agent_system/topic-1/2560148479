In this technical note, a distributed velocity-constrained consensus problem is studied for discrete-time multi-agent systems, where each agent's velocity is constrained to lie in a nonconvex set. A distributed constrained control algorithm is proposed to enable all agents to converge to a common point using only local information. The gains of the algorithm for all agents need not to be the same or predesigned and can be adjusted by each agent itself based on its own and neighbors' information. It is shown that the algorithm is robust to arbitrarily bounded communication delays and arbitrarily switching communication graphs provided that the union of the graphs has directed spanning trees among each certain time interval. The analysis approach is based on multiple novel model transformations, proper control parameter selections, boundedness analysis of state-dependent stochastic matrices1, exploitation of the convexity of stochastic matrices, and the joint connectivity of the communication graphs. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the theoretical results.
