This paper considers the distributed adaptive output feedback consensus problem for linear multiagent systems with matched nonlinear functions and actuator bias faults under directed communication topology. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Unlike the existing results, the dimensions of output and input vectors considered in this paper may be different by exchanging the order of fuzzy basis functions and weight vectors in fuzzy logic systems. By introducing adaptive mechanisms, a distributed adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is designed, which only depends on the information from neighbors. In addition, it is shown that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method.
