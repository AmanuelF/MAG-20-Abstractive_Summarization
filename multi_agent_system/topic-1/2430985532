This paper investigates the guaranteed cost consensus problem for multi-agent systems with actuator faults/uncertainties. For the leaderless case with actuator faults, a global performance index is constructed by all states and control inputs of all agents, where consensus regulation performances and control energy costs are considered simultaneously. Then, based on the relative state information of neighboring agents, a distributed cooperative guaranteed cost controller is designed, which not only makes the consensus problem solvable but also provides an upper bound of the given global performance index even in the presence of actuator faults. Extensions to the leader-following case with actuator faults and uncertainties are further studied. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. HighlightsThe impacts of actuator faults on leaderless consensus are studied.The impacts of both actuator faults and uncertainties on leader-following consensus are investigated.Based on the relative state information of neighboring agents, a distributed cooperative guaranteed cost controller is designed.A general approach is developed to simultaneously consider consensus regulation performances and control energy costs.
