In this paper, the distributed adaptive event-triggered fault-tolerant consensus of general linear multiagent systems (MASs) is considered. First, in order to deal with multiplicative fault, a distributed event-triggered consensus protocol is designed. Using distributed adaptive online updating strategies, the computation of the minimum eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix is avoided. Second, some adaptive parameters are introduced in trigger function to improve the self-regulation ability of event-triggered mechanism. The new trigger threshold is both state-dependent and time-dependent, which is independent of the number of agents. Then sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the leaderless and leader-following consensus. On the basis of this, the results are extended to the case of actuator saturation. It is proved the Zeno-behavior of considered event-triggered mechanism is avoided. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated by three simulation examples.
