This paper considers the cooperative adaptive output feedback control problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems with actuator failures. By constructing local filters to estimate the unmeasurable states, an effective cooperative adaptive fault-tolerant controller is developed. Furthermore, by introducing additional local estimators to estimate the unknown parameters involved in its neighbor's dynamics, the extra transmissions of online parameter estimators among the linked subsystems are avoided. In addition, it is proved that the proposed control protocol guarantees the consensus output tracking errors converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin and all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
