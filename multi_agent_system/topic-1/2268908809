This paper proposes a strategy to estimate the velocity and position of neighbor agents using distance measurements only. Since with agents executing arbitrary motions, instantaneous distance-only measurements cannot provide enough information for our objectives, we postulate that agents engage in a combination of circular motion and linear motion. The proposed estimator can be used to develop control algorithms where only distance measurements are available to each agent. As an example, we show how this estimation method can be used to control the formation shape and secure velocity consensus of the agents in a multi agent system.
