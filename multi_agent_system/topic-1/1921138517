SUMMARY In this paper, we proposed a new hybrid control algorithm to achieve leader–follower flocking in multi-agent systems. In the algorithm, the position is transmitted continuously, whereas the velocity is utilized discretely, which is governed by a distributed event-triggered mechanism, and the neighbors' velocity is not required to detect the event-triggered condition for each agent. It is shown that stable flocking is achieved asymptotically while the connectivity of networks is preserved. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the theoretical results.
