This paper studies the distributed fault-tolerant control (DFTC) problem for a class of high-order multi-agent systems (MASs) with switching undirected topologies, heterogeneous matching uncertainties, disturbances and actuator faults including loss of effectiveness, bias, outage and stuck. In this frame work, the communication network of dynamic agents may switch among several undirected connected graphs. It is assumed that the actuator efficiency factors, the lower and upper bounds of the time-varying failures and heterogeneous uncertainties, disturbances and the leader's control input signal, are unknown. Based on the relative information of neighbors, a novel fault-tolerant consensus tracking protocol is designed for each follower node via distributed adaptive mechanism. By utilizing the multiple Lyapunov functions method and algebraic graph theory, a sufficient condition for consensus tracking is established. Furthermore, it is proved that if the topology dwell time is larger than a positive threshold, the state of each follower node synchronizes to that of the leader with a bounded residual error in the presence of actuator faults, heterogeneous matching uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
