Abstract In this work, we present a new distributed adaptive iterative learning control (AILC) scheme for a class of high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) under alignment condition with both parametric and nonparametric system uncertainties, where the actuators may be faulty and the control input gain functions are not fully known. Backstepping design with the composite energy function (CEF) structure is used in the discussion. Through rigorous analysis, we show that under this new AILC scheme, uniform convergence of agents output tracking error over the iteration domain is guaranteed. In the end, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AILC scheme.
