One of the perquisites of a talk like this is that I get to expound on broad themes. AAMAS is a conference about agents and multiples of agents, so I probably ought to say something about agents. Of course, my position on agents is that I am all for them. Today I'd like to make a case for actually putting agents in agent-based models. I hope that by the end of the talk you have some idea about what I mean by this.
