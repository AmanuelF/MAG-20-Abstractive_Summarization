Summary This paper addresses output regulation of heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems. We first show that output regulation can be achieved through local controller design, then we formulate output regulation in the graphical game framework. To solve output regulation of heterogeneous linear multi-agent system in the graphical game framework, one needs to derive a solution to the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi equations. Both offline and online algorithms are suggested for that solution. Using the online method, the profile policy converges to a Nash Equilibrium. Besides, it is shown that the graphical formulation is robust to the multiplicative uncertainty satisfying an upper bound and it has an infinite gain margin. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
