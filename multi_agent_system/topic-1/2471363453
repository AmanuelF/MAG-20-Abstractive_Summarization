The importance of static output feedback (OPFB) design for aircraft control, process control, and elsewhere has been well documented since the 1960s, since full state measurements are not usually available in practical systems. This problem is compounded in the case of multi-agent systems (MAS) where each agent has its own state variable and measured outputs. Therefore, this paper addresses the L 2 -gain OPFB synchronization of linear MAS subject to external disturbances. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous MAS are considered. For homogeneous MAS, it is shown that the L 2 -gain static OPFB synchronization problem of MAS can be cast into the L 2 -gain static OPFB problem for a set of decoupled systems that depend on the graph topology. A modified Riccati equation is introduced which gives the OPFB gain and the coupling gain of the proposed static OPFB control protocol. For heterogeneous MAS, it is shown that the L 2 -gain synchronization problem can be cast into the L 2 -gain static OPFB problem of a set of decoupled systems plus a coupling condition on their dynamic compensators that depends on the graph topology. A certain novel gain matrix is introduced in the dynamics of the control protocol to improve the performance.
