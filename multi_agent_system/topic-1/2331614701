This paper deals with the consensus control problem for Lipschitz nonlinear multiagent systems with input delay. A prediction of the agent state over the delay period is approximated by the zero input solution of the agent dynamics. The structure of a linear state feedback control algorithm is assumed for each agent based on such approximated state prediction. By transforming the Laplacian matrix into the real Jordan form, sufficient conditions are established under which the multiagent systems under the proposed control algorithms achieve global consensus. The feedback gain is then designed by solving these conditions with an iterative linear matrix inequality procedure. A simulation study is given to validate the proposed control design.
