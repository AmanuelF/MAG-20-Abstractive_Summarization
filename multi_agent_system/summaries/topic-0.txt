the robots are self - propelled , and each robot is equipped with a ses equipped with a set of sensors and actuators that are capable of detecting and detecting obstacles . we demonstrate that these barrier functions are able to overcome the large scale noise and the small number of obstacles encountered during the test . we also demonstrate that the barrier functions can be used to define the relationship between the barrier functions and the robot 's position . we demonstrate that this relationship can be used to infer the robot 's position in space , and thus to the proposed scheme is based on a simple assumption : that the state on : that the state of
