This paper is devoted to a distributed consensus problem for second-order multiagent systems with nonconvex velocity and control input constraints. A distributed control algorithm is introduced using local information. It is shown that consensus can be achieved as long as the union of the communication graphs has directed spanning trees among each time interval of certain bounded length in the presence of arbitrarily bounded communication delays. Finally, a numerical example is included to illustrate the theoretical results.
