We investigate the problem of reliable decentralized fault prognosis of partially-observed discrete-event systems. In this problem, ${n}$ local prognosers are deployed to send their local prognostic decisions to a coordinator that calculates the final prognostic decision. However, only ${k}~ {(1\leq k\leq n)}$ local prognostic decisions are guaranteed to be available to the coordinator due to possible failures or communication losses of at most ${n-k}$ local prognosers. We propose the notion of ${k}$ -reliable decentralized prognoser in order to address this reliability issue. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a ${k}$ -reliable decentralized prognoser, which predicts faults prior to their occurrences, is presented. This condition is termed as ${k}$ -reliable coprognosability. A polynomial-time algorithm for the verification of ${k}$ -reliable coprognosability is presented. We also demonstrate how to compute the ${k}$ -reliable reactive bound prior to any occurrence of faults.
