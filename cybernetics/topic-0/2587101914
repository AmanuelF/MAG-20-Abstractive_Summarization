This paper proposes a diagnostics tool for a Discrete-Event System (DES) under uncertain activation conditions. This diagnosis tool, the diagnoser (as it is called), detects, identifies, and locates system faults in relation to a set of states of which the system under diagnosis could possibly be located, upon the diagnoser's instance of activation. This diagnoser is designed to diagnose system faults that occur prior to and/or after the diagnoser's activation; thus removing the procedural constraint of initializing the system and diagnoser synchronously. Illustrative examples are provided to detail the proposed diagnosis procedure.
