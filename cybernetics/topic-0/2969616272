This chapter concludes this book, and looks at the way the stories are changing to be somewhat more inclusive, though acknowledging that there remains a long way to go. It begins by reiterating some of the themes from previous chapters, including that of the potential for self-replication and the potential for sex robot revolt, while discussing the perils of giving something an emotive capability, forgetting that rage, hatred, and the will to survive are also emotions. It also looks at the diversity of the emerging sci-fi and examines how such ideas fit into the greater narrative. It also contains a peek at the very newest of advancements in cybernetics and AI, examining biofeedback prosthetics, ‘learning’ AI, and following the latest news on Sophia, the Saudi citizen robot.
