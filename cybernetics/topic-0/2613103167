Social synchrony (SS) is an emergent phenomenon in human society. People often mimic others which, over time, can result in large groups behaving similarly. Drawing from prior empirical studies of SS in online communities, here we propose a discrete network model of SS based on four attributes: 1) depth of action; 2) breadth of impact, i.e., a large number of actions are performed with a large group of people involved; 3) heterogeneity of role, i.e., people of higher degree play more important roles; and 4) lastly, emergence of phenomenon, i.e., it is far from random. We analyze our model both analytically and with simulations, and find good agreement between the two. We find this model can well explain the four characters of SS, and thus hope it can help researchers better understand human collective behavior.
