This paper investigates the problem of robust fault estimation (FE) observer design for discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems via homogenous polynomially parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. First, a novel framework of the fuzzy FE observer is established with the help of a maximum–minimum-priority-based switching mechanism. Then, for every activated switching case, a targeted result is achieved by the aid of exploring an important property of improved homogenous polynomials. Since the helpful information of the underlying system can be duly updated and effectively utilized at every sampled point, the conservatism of previous results is availably reduced. Furthermore, the proposed result is further improved by eliminating those redundant terms of the introduced matrix-valued variables. Simulation results based on a discrete-time nonlinear truck-trailer model are provided to show the advantages of the theoretic result that is developed in this paper.
