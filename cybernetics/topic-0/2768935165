Purpose The purpose of the paper is to set out ideas regarding the use of both first- and second-order cybernetics in reducing global energy-based emissions through energy technology innovation at multiple levels and to discuss necessary production and consumption patterns to facilitate such changes over time. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a conceptual framework to estimate a national model of energy consumption and production, conceived as embedded hypercubes for different actor levels. The author has developed a model that elaborates on a multi-level ecosystem for low-carbon technology adoption and innovation, embedded within a sustainability transition framework. Findings The paper reviews productâ€“process relationships at multiple levels and grounds the framework in a transition approach. With more contextually conceptualized framework grounded in theory, this research aims to inform future development in the topic area, given the embryonic emergence of advanced cybernetic technologies, by viewing such capabilities at the subsystem level as a unit of analysis. Originality/value The paper will be of interest to firm managers, ecologists and policymakers with a particular interest in system sciences. The framework can be applied for facilitating discussions or for scenario planning.
