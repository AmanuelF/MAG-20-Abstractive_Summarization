The increasing number of administrators in healthcare reflects a mental model of managerialism – a belief in the value of professional managers and of the concepts and methods they use. Among these methods is the use of “performance indicators.” These performance indicators are part of the control systems that administrators use to keep the health care “machine” running. This image of a machine emphasizes the aspects of the organization that are (supposedly) predictable, controllable and reproducible. While it is often hard to see the similarities between health care systems and other systems, such control systems are manifest in the hormonal axes that endocrinologists deal with every day. This chapter shows how a cybernetic model of hormonal axes involved in insulin secretion can serve as an analogy for the development and operation of performance measures for diabetes including some of the unintended consequences. Unintended consequences of actions in complicated or complex systems are a fact of life. Simple systems are predictable. Complicated systems may be computationally tractable and therefore predictable, although expertise is required. Lacking that expertise or the correct computer model, unintended consequences may come as a surprise. Unintended (and often unexpected) consequences are characteristic of action on complex systems; they emerge.
