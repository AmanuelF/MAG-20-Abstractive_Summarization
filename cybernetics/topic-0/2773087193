The estimation of the domain of attraction of a class of susceptible-infectious-removed-susceptible immigration is investigated. On assumption the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium existences, hence a Lyapunov function too, the domain of attraction of the epidemic model is estimated by means of LF-LMI-moment and SOS optimization approaches. An invariant subset of the domain of attraction, along with certain enlargement, has been achieved. Simulation results, given in a comparison presentation, demonstrate feasibility and validity of the proposed technique as well as reveal that this algorithm outperforms other ones in applications to epidemic models.
