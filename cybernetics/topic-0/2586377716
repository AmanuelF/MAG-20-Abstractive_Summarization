In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of a Kinect-based framework for human activity tracking. The framework is intentionally designed to be open so that it can communicate over the network with other systems and mobile/wearable devices. The possibility of integrating with other devices and systems makes it possible to use Kinect for human activity tracking in a way unforeseen before. For example, the integration of our framework with wearable sensors, such as smart watches and fitness bands, enables us to perform selective tracking of the daily activities of a particular user and provide realtime feedback to the user. Furthermore, multiple frameworks could work together to form a federated system to cover a large area and/or a large number of users.
