Machine learning has recently become very popular in cybernetics systems, but it has always been considered an important research area in the computational intelligence field. Nevertheless, when it comes to smart machines, it is not just about methodologies; we also need to consider systems, cybernetics, and sometimes even humans. R&#x000E9;mi Coulom, a freelance developer of Go programs, notes, "Online games are usually played at a faster pace, which favors the computer over humans," and, still, he expects a strong correlation in performance in serious tournament games [1]. This is why Go games were played on site rather than just on the Internet at the special event "Human and Smart Machine Co-Learning" [11], which was held during the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) on 5 October 2017 in Banff, Canada.
