Authorship attribution is a stylometric technique that associates text to authors based on the type of writing styles. Researchers have looked for ways to analyze the context of these texts, in some cases with limited results. Most of the approaches view information at the syntactic and physical levels and tend to ignore information from the semantic levels. In this paper, we present a technique that incorporates the use of semantic frames as a method for authorship attribution. We hypothesize that it provides a deeper view into the semantic level of texts, which is an influencing factor in a writer's style. We use a variety of online resources in a pipeline fashion to extract information about frames within the text. The results show that our “bag of frames” approach can be used successfully for stylometry.
