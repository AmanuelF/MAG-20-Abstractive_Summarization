This paper is concerned with the fault isolation problem for T–S fuzzy systems with sensor faults. With the help of a set theoretic description of T–S fuzzy models, a new fault isolation scheme is proposed. It consists of a set of fuzzy observers and each of them corresponds to a specified sensor, where the antecedent and consequent parts of the observer are independent on the sensor output. Different from the existing approaches, the premise variables, which do not depend on the specified sensor output but depend on the other sensor outputs, are used in the proposed observer, which has the potential to lead to a better fault isolation performance. In the end, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the fault isolation method.
