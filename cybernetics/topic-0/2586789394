As the technology for acquiring and storing images becomes more prevalent, we are faced with a growing need to sort and label these images. At this time, computer vision algorithms cannot parse abstract concepts from images like a human. As a result, there may be performance gains possible from the integration of human analysts with computer vision agents. We present an image triage system which facilitates the collaboration of heterogeneous agents through a novel unsupervised meta-learning technique. The system iteratively allocates images for binary classification among heterogeneous agents according to the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) and combines the classification results using the Spectral Meta-Learner (SML). In simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed system achieves significant speed-up over a naive parallel assignment strategy without sacrificing accuracy.
