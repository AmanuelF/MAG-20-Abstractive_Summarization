In this paper, we examine to what extent Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) simulations can be used to model and simulate a System of Systems (SoS) by (1) establishing LVC and SoS domain profiles based on concepts discussed in each community and (2) finding overlapping concepts. To do so, we apply content analysis to the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) conference papers to identify the driving concepts and relationships that are most associated with LVC systems. Similarly, we apply content analysis to the IEEE/Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE). We use the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization dataset to train a learner about LVC and automatically discover the LVC concepts and relationships within the SoS literature. Similarly, we use the SoS Engineering dataset to train a learner about SoS and use it to discover the concepts and relationships of SoS in the LVC literature. We show the two domains present some overlap on the ...
