Tensions arise from the structure of complex systems along the interrelated viability dimensions of control, change, and design. Unique system properties and performance emerge from system structure, that is, from the constitute functions and interrelationships comprising the complex system. Tensions are balanced in well-performing complex systems, but are potentially unbalanced when system performance is not meeting expectations, and implies that deficiencies exist in the underlying system structure. Systems theory propositions and management cybernetic principles provide a foundation to support the construct of system tensions and their evaluation. An understanding of system tensions can support the emerging paradigm of complex system governance and associated complex system governance development methodology through advancing of approaches that identify and quantify the potential degree of tension imbalance. Such approaches could provide systems practitioners with new ways to evaluate the cause of inadequate performance in complex systems in terms of inadequacies in underlying system structure and related system pathologies.
