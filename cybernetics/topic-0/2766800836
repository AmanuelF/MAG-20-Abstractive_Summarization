Incorporating theories of person-environment fit (PE fit), we develop a model of work-life balance (WLB) across time to better describe individuals with a full range of family structures (e.g., married or single, with or without children, and with elder care responsibilities), with personal interests in addition to family, and throughout career and life stages. We recognize that employeesâ€™ perceptions of WLB develop and change across time, and that those perceptions may affect the proportions of the three life domains (work, family, and personal) that constitute balance for the individual, as well as the actions they take to achieve and maintain balance. We propose a cybernetic model of WLB as influenced by individual values, career and life stage, family structure, role senders in the three domains, current perceptions of WLB, anticipated future WLB, and retrospections of WLB. Finally, we discuss the implications of the proposed model for future research and practice.
