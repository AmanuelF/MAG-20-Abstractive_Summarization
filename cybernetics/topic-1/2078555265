In this article, we proffer a theoretical integration of current emotions research and impression management (IM) tactics as applied to the workplace. Both IM and emotions frequently occur in organizational settings, but research has yet to consider how their simultaneous implementation may impact the ability of an individual to influence the perceptions others form of them. By integrating the emotions as social information model and a cybernetic model of IM, we attempt to explain the linkage between actor implementation of IM behaviour, paired affective displays, and downstream processing and resultant behaviour by a target. Situational and personal moderators that may impact this process are also discussed. Successful application of emotions in IM can have wide-ranging implications for outcomes of interest in human resource management, and these are discussed within several IM frameworks. Practitioner points We integrate theory and research on emotions and IM to help develop an understanding of their impact on others in the workplace. A model is provided to show how this integration may influence human resource management. Examples of this integration are shown via extant IM frameworks.
