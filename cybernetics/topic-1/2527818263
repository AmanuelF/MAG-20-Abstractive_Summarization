Cyberization, as a new big trend following computerization and informatization, is the process of forming a new cyberworld and transforming our current physical, social and mental worlds into novel cyber-combined worlds. Cyber science, responding to the cyberization trend, aims to create a new collection of knowledge about these cyber-enabled worlds, and provide a way of discovering what is in the cyber-enabled worlds and how they work. Cyber science is concerned with the study of phenomena caused or generated by the cyberworld and cyber-physical, cyber-social and cyber-mental worlds, as well as the complex intertwined integration of cyber physical, social and mental worlds. It fuels advances in cyber technology, beyond the existing cyber related technologies. In this paper, after discussing the cyberization background and process, and explaining cyber science and technology, we present our visions and perspectives on new opportunities, essential issues and major challenges for cyber science and technology. We further describe cyber related technologies and closely related existing research areas, and envision future research directions, in terms of cyber physical, cyber social, cyber life, cyber intelligence and cyber security, which are five basic dimensions of cyber science and technology.
