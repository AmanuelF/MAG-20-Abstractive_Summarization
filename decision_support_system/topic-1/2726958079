Abstract In the last few years researchers have focused more on non-intrusive based frameworks to measure Heart Rate. This is because of the ease and lack of expense in utilization. RGB videos are used by most of the non-intrusive based systems as it is appropriate for experiments. However, there exists some challenges before they can be implemented in real time applications. Heart rate monitoring using RGB videos is inefficient in outdoor environment because light has significant impact on RGB videos. This approach introduces a heart rate measuring strategy using LAB color facial video. Here we have to note that blood circulation causes variation in facial skin color and heart rate can be extracted through these variations. Heart rate is subsequently measured and compared with a reference measurement. This technique has noteworthy potential for advancing telemedicine, health of a person and numerous applications where information is needed on a real time basis.
