Abstract The mining and extractive industryâ€™s operations have significant harmful environmental consequences. Mining companies have started adopting green supply chain management (GSCM) practices which include green information technology systems (GITS) to help provide economic benefits while seeking minimal environmental damage. These mining organizations face significant hurdles related to introducing and implementing various GSCM practices which can address some of the environmental burdens. This study addresses this issue by adopting a GSCM practices framework and applying a novel decision support method that integrates grey numbers with DEMATEL and the NK model for evaluating and developing an implementation path model. Using a multiple case field study with input from managers of the Ghanaian gold mining industry, the adopted GSCM practices framework and methodology is applied. The results provide an evaluation and development path model to guide these organizations and managers for GSCM planning and investment decisions. The path results show that these organizations should first develop SSP (Strategic Supplier Partnership) with their suppliers for implementing GITS (Green Information Technology and Systems) and other GSCM practices. These results provide some exploratory insight and guidelines for managers and policy-makers who seek to integrate green initiatives. This study also sets the stage for further investigation of organizational greening in developing countries and the mining industry.
