Data for military intelligence operations are increasing at astronomical rates. As a result, significant cognitive and temporal resources are required to determine which information is relevant to a particular situation. Soft computing techniques, such as fuzzy logic, have recently been applied toward decision support systems to support military intelligence analysts in selecting relevant and reliable data within the military decision making process. This article examines the development of one such system and its evaluation using a constructive simulation and human performance model to provided critical understanding of how this conceptual information system might interact with personnel, organizational, and system architectures. In addition, similarities between military intelligence analysts and cyber intelligence analysts are detailed along with a plan for transitioning the current fuzzy-based system to the cyber security domain.
