Wireless medical cyber-physical systems are widely adopted in the daily practices of medicine, where huge amounts of data are sampled by the wireless medical devices and sensors, and is passed to the decision support systems (DSSs). Many text-based guidelines have been encoded for work-flow simulation of DSS to automate health care based on those collected data. But for some complex and life-critical diseases, it is highly desirable to automatically rigorously verify some complex temporal properties encoded in those data, which brings new challenges to current simulation-based DSS with limited support of automatical formal verification and real-time data analysis. In this paper, we conduct the first study on applying runtime verification to cooperate with current DSS based on real-time data. Within the proposed technique, a user-friendly domain specific language, named DRTV, is designed to specify vital real-time data sampled by medical devices and temporal properties originated from clinical guidelines. Some interfaces are developed for data acquisition and communication. Then, for medical practice scenarios described in DRTV model, we will automatically generate event sequences and runtime property verifier automata. If a temporal property violates, real-time warnings will be produced by the formal verifier and passed to medical DSS. We have used DRTV to specify different kinds of medical care scenarios and have applied the proposed technique to assist existing wireless medical cyber-physical system. As presented in experiment results, in terms of warning detection, it outperforms the only use of DSS or human inspection, and improves the quality of clinical health care of hospital.
