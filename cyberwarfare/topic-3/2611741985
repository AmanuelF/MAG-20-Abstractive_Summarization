ABSTRACTSuicide is a growing concern in the virtual warrior community of the United States Air Force (USAF). Identifying risk factors for suicide that are unique to this community of military personnel is therefore critical. A total of 4,340 USAF remote warriors (27.8% remotely piloted aircraft, 60.3% intelligence, and 11.9% cyber warfare operators) completed anonymous surveys that assessed demographic, occupational demands, psychological distress, and suicide ideation. Suicide ideation was self-reported by 5â€“6% of participants. Results of multinomial logistic regression indicated that burnout increased risk for suicide ideation, but not when psychological distress was included as a covariate.
