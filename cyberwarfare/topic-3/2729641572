The last century witnessed sweeping changes in the technologies of destruction and the abilities of states to suppress dissent. States now wield unprecedented capabilities to detect and target those who would concentrate force against them, whether on a battlefield or even in private spaces. Digital information processing accelerated these developments, to the point where the term “cyber war” now seems redundant. Such developments promise to continue as ideological regimes crave external threats to justify mobilization of their citizens. Anti-liberal rulers cannot tolerate open borders with liberal democracies; thus, they seek to keep those borders closed, or those neighbors less free. The boundaries around repressive regimes are now the tectonic plates of conflict, and of modern warfare. Technology has progressed to the point that these fault lines now extend into cyberspace, the newest domain of conflict.
