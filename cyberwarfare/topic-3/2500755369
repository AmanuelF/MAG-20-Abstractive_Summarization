This chapter focuses on the significance of CS in the context of broader national security and international relations issues facing nations. It first provides a review of initiatives and measures introduced by the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime as well as by other international and regional organizations and relevant bodies and fora for reducing cyber-threats and promoting greater cyber peace. It then argues that despite these encouraging attempts, the widespread allegations and counter-allegations involving the cyberspace among major economies and some nationsâ€™ engagement in the cyberwar arms race point to the fact that the current legal regimes, institutional frameworks and instruments are insufficient, inappropriate and ineffective to address cyber-threats. We draw on the literatures in international organization, white collar crimes, security studies, cybersecurity and other areas to explore the nature, sources, and consequences of cyber-threats and specify possible actions that nations can take to deal with various deficiencies of the current regimes, frameworks and instruments.
