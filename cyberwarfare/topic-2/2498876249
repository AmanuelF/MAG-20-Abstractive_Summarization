This paper examines cyber conflict using a lens of ‘winning’ or ‘losing’, or alternatively the role of ‘victory’ or ‘triumph’ compared to that of ‘defeat’, to draw broader conclusions about the dynamics of cyber power. To do so, the paper analyses writing on the general topic of winning over the years, then dives into the two most critical key case studies: the 2007 attacks on Estonia, and the 2008–2015 conflict between the United States and Iran. It addresses the most relevant factors for these cases, including a summary of the participants in the conflict and which side ‘won’ or ‘lost’ and why. After these case studies, the paper will address larger questions of winning and losing and the implications for our understanding of cyber power.
