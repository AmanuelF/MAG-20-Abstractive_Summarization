This work aims to assess how the infrastructure of production & transport of the electric energy can be annihilated in a nation-state through a cyber attack, as a particular form of manifestation of cybernetic warfare. In this study we consider that the purpose of the cyber attack is only to remove servers from service, logically or physically. There are several standards that integrate the business side of a company with the level of supervision of industrial infrastructure and with the level of control engineering. These levels are integrated and are using different protocols. To simulate cyber-attacks between the countries with flexible potential escalation there are used BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agents which allow to separate treatment of different types of attacks. Inspired by the study of nuclear attacks implemented using the game theory, the flexibility of the BDI paradigm increases research potential of decision trees using this type of agent in other areas of human existence, like modeling human behavior at policy states makers or cyberspace executive users.
