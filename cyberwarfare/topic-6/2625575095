This paper introduces the Cyber - Forces Interactions Terrain (FIT) Simulation Framework. This framework provides an apparatus with which to carry out virtual experiments involving cyber warfare engagements. Our agent-based modelling approach is a first attempt at providing the necessary components with which military planners can reason about cyber force projections on varying terrains and against various adversarial forces. We simulate and then predict the results of cyber warfare at the level historically desired by military planners: vulnerabilities, asset degradation, and mission capability rate.
