Sweat potentially contains a wealth of physiologically relevant information, but has traditionally been an underutilized resource for non-invasive health monitoring. Recent advances in wearable sweat sensors have overcome many of the historic drawbacks of sweat sensing and such sensors now offer methods of gleaning molecular-level insight into the dynamics of our bodies. Here we review key developments in sweat sensing technology. We highlight the potential value of sweat-based wearable sensors, examine state-of-the-art devices and the requirements of the underlying components, and consider ways to tackle data integrity issues within these systems. We also discuss challenges and opportunities for wearable sweat sensors in the development of personalized healthcare.
