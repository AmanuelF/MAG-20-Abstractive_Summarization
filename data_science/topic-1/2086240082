The evolution of smartphones together with increasing computational power has empowered developers to create innovative context-aware applications for recognizing user-related social and cognitive activities in any situation and at any location. The existence and awareness of the context provide the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around mobile device users. This allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. The key idea behind context-aware applications is to encourage users to collect, analyze, and share local sensory knowledge in the purpose for a large-scale community use by creating a smart network. The desired network is capable of making autonomous logical decisions to actuate environmental objects and also assist individuals. However, many open challenges remain, which are mostly arisen because the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory, and bandwidth. Thus, it becomes critically important to study how the drawbacks can be elaborated and resolved and, at the same time, better understand the opportunities for the research community to contribute to the context-awareness. To this end, this paper surveys the literature over the period of 1991â€“2014 from the emerging concepts to applications of context-awareness in mobile platforms by providing up-to-date research and future research directions. Moreover, it points out the challenges faced in this regard and enlightens them by proposing possible solutions.
