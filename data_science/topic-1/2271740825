ABSTRACTEfforts have been made to relate measured concentrations of airborne constituents to their origins for more than 50 years. During this time interval, there have been developments in the measurement technology to gather highly time-resolved, detailed chemical compositional data. Similarly, the improvements in computers have permitted a parallel development of data analysis tools that permit the extraction of information from these data. There is now a substantial capability to provide useful insights into the sources of pollutants and their atmospheric processing that can help inform air quality management options. Efforts have been made to combine receptor and chemical transport models to provide improved apportionments. Tools are available to utilize limited numbers of known profiles with the ambient data to obtain more accurate apportionments for targeted sources. In addition, tools are in place to allow more advanced models to be fitted to the data based on conceptual models of the nature of th...
