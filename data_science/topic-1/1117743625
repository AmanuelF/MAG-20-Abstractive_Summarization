Big data (BD) has attracted increasing attention from both academics and practitioners. This paper aims at illustrating the role of big data analytics in supporting world-class sustainable manufacturing (WCSM). Using an extensive literature review to identify different factors that enable the achievement of WCSM through BD and 405 usable responses from senior managers gathered through social networking sites (SNS), we propose a conceptual framework using constructs obtained using reduction of gathered data that summarizes this role; test this framework using data which is heterogeneous, diverse, voluminous, and possess high velocity; and highlight the importance for academia and practice. Finally, we conclude our research findings and further outlined future research directions.
