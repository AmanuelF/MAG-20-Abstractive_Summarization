Technology has a long track record of enabling and accelerating scientific discovery and innovation. Two prime examples are the telescope and the microscope; although these predate the industrial revolution, both can be found in todayâ€™s laboratories throughout the world and they remain at the center of our scientific endeavors. In a similar way, as scientists depend on these instruments for observing the natural world, most of us have come to depend on our smartphones as tools for organizing and navigating our daily lives. Our use of these devices generates, as a byproduct, a surprisingly rich tapestry of social and behavioral fingerprints. Given that these digital fingerprints reflect the lived experiences of people in their natural environments, with granular temporal resolution, it might be possible to leverage them to develop precise and temporally dynamic disease phenotypes and markers to diagnose and treat psychiatric and other illnesses.
