Abstract Radiomics is an emerging field in quantitative imaging that uses advanced imaging features to objectively and quantitatively describe tumour phenotypes. Radiomic features have recently drawn considerable interest due to its potential predictive power for treatment outcomes and cancer genetics, which may have important applications in personalized medicine. In this technical review, we describe applications and challenges of the radiomic field. We will review radiomic application areas and technical issues, as well as proper practices for the designs of radiomic studies.
