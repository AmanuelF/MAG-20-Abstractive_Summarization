This study introduces the knowledge fusion taxonomy to understand the relationships among traditional marketing analytics (TMA), big data analytics (BDA), and new product success (NPS). With high volume and speed of information and knowledge from different stakeholders in the digital economy, the taxonomy aims to help firms build strategy to combine knowledge from both marketing and big data domains. The study suggests that knowledge fusion to improve NPS is not automatic and requires strategic choices to obtain its benefits.
