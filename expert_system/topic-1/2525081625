This study examines the organizational factors associated with the successful implementation of expert systems (ES), using data from a survey of organizations that have actually implemented ES for their operations. The results show that organizations that practice strategic information systems (IS) planning have management support for IS and have IS diffused across the organization tend to derive more value-added benefits from ES implementation. The results also show that organizations with more decentralized decision-making structure tend to derive more productivity-related benefits from ES implementation. These findings will be useful to managers in assessing the appropriateness of their organizations to ES implementation and further improving the ES implementation practice.
