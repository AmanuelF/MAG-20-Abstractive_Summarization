Adaptive approaches to measurement and assessment have been useful in organizational science for more than 100 years. Advances in psychometric theory and inexpensive computing power have propelled the field into a renaissance for every type of construct and level of analysis imaginable. Exciting innovations include the use of mobile computer-adaptive testing (CAT); expert systems (e.g., automatic item generation); and unobtrusive adaptive measurement in social media, intelligent tutoring systems, and virtual worlds. Adaptive approaches are setting the stage to better embed measurement and intervention into naturalistic organizational settings and portend substantial improvements in cross-level and longitudinal tests of organizational psychology and organizational behavior (OP/OB) hypotheses.
