Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are algorithmically controlled mechanisms involving networked devices [1]. Whereas physical components of CPS (e.g., robots sand devices) are tangible, embodied, and occupy physical space, cyber components are largely disembodied, intangible, and location-independent. As such, internet of things (IoT) are a subset of CPS. In sharp contrast to the passive view for entities of things as objects, agent inhabitants of IoT are active and may take action proactively. In this perspective, things are enlivened with agent overlays that take advantage of smart sensors and provide intended decision making capacities for things.
