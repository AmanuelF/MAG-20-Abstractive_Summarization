ABSTRACTThe article presents a fuzzy expert system designed to determine the possible radar range of the ARS-880. The aim of the project is to develop a fuzzy controller which will allow generating the range extent depending on the sea conditions and the radar cross-section of the tracked object. The project uses Matlab and Fuzzy Logic Toolbox software. The authors present the performance of the system based on 18 samples for research. They perform an automatic simulation, which takes into account various weather conditions at sea as well as different size floating objects.
