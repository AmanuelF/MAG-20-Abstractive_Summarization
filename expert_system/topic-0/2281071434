AbstractDeveloping an expert system has been considered as complex and knowledge driven process. This study proposes a nature-inspired metaheuristic regression system that can find appropriate solutions. The system uses a graphical user interface but does not require a mathematical program installation. The user-friendly interface was designed in the MATLAB graphical user interface design environment (GUIDE) and was implemented by MATLAB compiler. The stand-alone system is easy to use and has many functions, including evaluation, use of an opened data file, test set selection, hold-out, cross validation, and prediction to solve many civil engineering problems with simple manipulations on the system interface. Five benchmark functions were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization module. The performance of the proposed regression system was then validated by comparing its solutions obtained for civil engineering problems with those obtained by empirical methods reported previously. Five actua...
