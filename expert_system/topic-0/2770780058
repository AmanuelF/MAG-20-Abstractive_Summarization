Computer aided process planning is a critical link between design and manufacturing. The ready process plan in integration of design and manufacturing is always important to save manufacturing time, reduction of work in progress. This paper describes a rule based intelligent process planning system which selects necessary manufacturing processes features in the metal mechanical parts. Novel feature of this system is the use of detailed GD&T specification on both process selection and setup planning modules. Process selection module selects the necessary processes for manufacturing the hole feature that depends on feature dimensions, feature precedence, and specified geometric and dimensional tolerances. Setup planning module determines the sequences of the setups of the prismatic part on the machine tools that includes clustering and sequencing of the features in setups. This module uses rules for the following steps: tool approach direction definition, setup formation based on GD&T requirements, resolution of possible cyclic setups, setup sequencing and operation sequencing in setups. Rules can generate valid setups for both 3-axis and 4-axis milling machines. The procedures are illustrated on several examples.
