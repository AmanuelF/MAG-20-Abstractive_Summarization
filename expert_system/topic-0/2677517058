Since the introduction of electronic data processing systems (EDP) in the early 1960s, computer-based information systems have gone through tremendous developments in both capability and design. In recent years, one type of advanced information systems, expert systems (ES), has made its appearance and is evolving at a steadily increasing pace, not only in concept development, but also in practical applications. This paper tries to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current ES, and then provides insights into the future improvements of ES.
