Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as expert systems (ESs), fuzzy logic (FL), and artificial neural networks (ANNs or NNWs) have brought an advancing frontier in power electronics and power engineering. These techniques provide powerful tools for design, simulation, control, estimation, fault diagnostics, and fault-tolerant control in modern smart grid (SG) and renewable energy systems (RESs). The AI technology has gone through fast evolution during last several decades, and their applications have increased rapidly in modern industrial systems. This special issue will remain incomplete without some discussion on AI applications in SG and RESs. The paper will discuss some novel application examples of AI in these areas. These applications are automated design of modern wind generation system and its health monitoring in the operating condition, fault pattern identification of an SG subsystem, and control of SG based on real-time simulator. The concepts of these application examples can be expanded to formulate many other applications. In the beginning of the paper, the basic features of AI that are relevant to these applications have been briefly reviewed.
