Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) are a vital modeling technique for the construction of knowledge-based systems, which have been commonly used in many fields, such as fault diagnosis, risk assessment, workflow management, and disassembly process planning. However, the conventional FPNs have been blamed for the following reasons: 1) the representation parameters in FPNs cannot precisely model experts' experience since it is difficult to manage the fuzziness and randomness of knowledge assessments simultaneously, and 2) the weight coefficients in the existing approximate reasoning algorithms are hardly enough to reflect the associated weights of reordered places. In response, we propose a new type of FPNs, called cloud reasoning Petri nets (CRPNs) based on the concept of interval clouds and the hybrid averaging operator. The cloud production rules in a knowledge-based system are modeled by CRPNs, where the truth degrees of places, the certainty factors of rules, and the thresholds of transitions are represented by interval clouds. Moreover, a matrix operation-based reasoning algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of calculating final truth degrees, in which both local and ordered weight coefficients are taken into consideration. Finally, a practical example concerning a power system is provided to demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of the proposed CRPN model.
