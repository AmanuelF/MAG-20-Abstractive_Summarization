This paper describes an expert system to predict National Hockey League (NHL) game outcome. A new method based on both data and judgments is used to estimate the hockey game performance. There are many facts and judgments that could influence an outcome. We employed the support vector machine to determine the importance of these factors before we incorporate them into the prediction system. Our system combines data and judgments and used them to predict the winâ€“lose outcome of all the 89 post-season games before they took place. The accuracy of our prediction with the combined factors was 77.5%. This is to date the best accuracy reported of hockey games prediction.
