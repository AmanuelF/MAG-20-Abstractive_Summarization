The aim of this study was to strengthen the engineering curriculum by integrating innovative electrical and computer engineering (ECE)-specialized artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies and algorithms into traditional civil engineering (CE) problem-solving methods. An interactive and comprehensive knowledge-based expert system (KBES) was developed to document, compare, and analyze cutting-edge AI applications in the field of CE. With a large amount of successful/unsuccessful AI applications being tried and tested in the CE field, this unique intelligent database can be used as the platform and educational media for the development and implementation of curricula for the problem-based learning approach to bridge the gap in the current curricula between conventional mathematics, physics, engineering methods and state-of-the-art AI techniques. This study is the first of its kind to (1) develop an intelligent KBES platform to increase the intellectual rigor, breadth, and depth of undergraduate engineering...
