ObjectiveWe present the implementation and application of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system for breast cancer related diagnoses. By retrieving similar cases in a breast cancer decision support system, oncologists can obtain powerful information or knowledge, complementing their own experiential knowledge, in their medical decision making. MethodsWe observed two problems in applying standard CBR to this context: the abundance of different types of attributes and the difficulty in eliciting appropriate attribute weights from human experts. We therefore used a distance measure named weighted heterogeneous value distance metric, which can better deal with both continuous and discrete attributes simultaneously than the standard Euclidean distance, and a genetic algorithm for learning the attribute weights involved in this distance measure automatically. We evaluated our CBR system in two case studies, related to benign/malignant tumor prediction and secondary cancer prediction, respectively. ResultWeighted heterogeneous value distance metric with genetic algorithm for weight learning outperformed several alternative attribute matching methods and several classification methods by at least 3.4%, reaching 0.938, 0.883, 0.933, and 0.984 in the first case study, and 0.927, 0.842, 0.939, and 0.989 in the second case study, in terms of accuracy, sensitivityspecificity, F measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively. ConclusionThe evaluation result indicates the potential of CBR in the breast cancer diagnosis domain.
