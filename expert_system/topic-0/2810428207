Soft computing (SC) is a newly emerging multidisciplinary field. It is a collection of computational techniques, such as expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms, which provide information processing capabilities to solve complex practical problems. The major benefit of SC lies in its ability to tolerate imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation in processing imprecise and inaccurate information and simulating human decision making at low cost. This paper provides a brief introduction on soft computing.
