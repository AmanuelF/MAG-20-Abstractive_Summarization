Abstract Traffic monitoring is the process of observing and collecting data that describes the use and performance of the roadway systems. Strong and effective traffic monitoring program not only improves the mobility on roadways and reliability of decisions based on traffic data, but also ensures states are receiving appropriate federal funding. Rapidly evolving traffic data collection technologies; changing computing and communication technologies; receiving, processing and understanding of big data sets; economic, environmental and geographic constraints for data collection; and many other general or state specific limitations increased the complexity of traffic monitoring programs. This study aims to investigate the use of knowledge-automation expert systems in statesâ€™ traffic monitoring programs. This proposed approach is expected to increase the understanding and use of traffic data by providing situation specific advice based on user input and requests.
