Catalysis informatics is a distinct subfield that lies at the intersection of cheminformatics and materials informatics but with distinctive challenges arising from the dynamic, surface-sensitive, and multiscale nature of heterogeneous catalysis. The ideas behind catalysis informatics can be traced back decades, but the field is only recently emerging due to advances in data infrastructure, statistics, machine learning, and computational methods. In this work, we review the field from early works on expert systems and knowledge engines to more recent approaches utilizing machine-learning and uncertainty quantification. The data–information–knowledge hierarchy is introduced and used to classify various developments. The chemical master equation and microkinetic models are proposed as a quantitative representation of catalysis knowledge, which can be used to generate explanative and predictive hypotheses for the understanding and discovery of catalytic materials. We discuss future prospects for the field, i...
