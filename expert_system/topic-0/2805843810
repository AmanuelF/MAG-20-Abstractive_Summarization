It is widely held that leadership consists of behaviors that should be applied strategically and systematically to motivate individuals and teams to perform. It is also self-evident that we live in a world of automation, artificial intelligence, and expert systems. Given these two assertions, we propose that some aspects of leadership are candidates for automation. This paper briefly reviews relevant leadership literature and describes three leadership behaviors that may be possibly automated: goal setting, performance monitoring, and performance consequences. The paper also explores the relationship of different embodiments of the artificial leaders and the impact of these embodiments as varying degrees of social presence and the effect of this presence on performance and satisfaction outcomes.
