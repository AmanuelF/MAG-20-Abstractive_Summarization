Intelligent scheduling covers various tools and techniques for successfully and efficiently solving the scheduling problems. In this paper, we provide a survey of intelligent scheduling systems by categorizing them into five major techniques containing fuzzy logic, expert systems, machine learning, stochastic local search optimization algorithms and constraint programming. We also review the application case studies of these techniques.
