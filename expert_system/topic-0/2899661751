Expert systems still constitute a growing segment of computer-based information systems. Much has been written about their usefulness (2, 41) as well as general guidelines given for their development (42). However, little has been written to address the crucial initial development stage of knowledge acquisition. For those considering developing an expert system for their own organizational needs, it is important to recognize the various knowledge elicitation techniques available to capture this knowledge. Failure to recognize 1) the existence of different types of human knowledge used in systems, 2) the ways this knowledge can be represented in the system, and 3) the knowledge elicitation techniques appropriate to elicit that knowledge, can result in what is known as “representational mismatch” in the system (19).
