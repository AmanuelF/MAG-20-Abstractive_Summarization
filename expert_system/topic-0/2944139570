Current techniques of knowledge management have some common defects in efficiency, scalability, and applicability. Knowledge graph provides a new way for knowledge management and is a more flexible knowledge management method. Considering the specific features of crop diseases and pest data, this paper analyzed and classified the key techniques and methods of knowledge graph technology in the field of crop diseases and pest in recent years. We introduced the definition and connotation of the crop diseases and pest knowledge, and the current construction method of it was analyzed in detail from four aspects: knowledge representation, extraction, fusion, and reasoning. Furthermore, the application of crop diseases and pest knowledge graph was introduced in detail in the expert system, search engine, and knowledge question-answering system. At last, this paper summarized the challenges and important problems of diseases and pest knowledge graph and forecasted the prospect of knowledge graph according to the key points and difficulties of current knowledge graph research.
