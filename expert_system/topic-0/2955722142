In this chapter, we describe what are best characterized as complex adaptive systems and give several mixture of expert systems as examples of these complex systems. This background discussion is followed by three theoretical sections covering the topics of kernel-based probability estimation systems, a generalized neural network example, and a derivation of an ensemble combination and finally, a two-view ensemble combination. A summary of the equations describing the oracle follows these sections for those readers who do not want to work through all that mathematics. The next section introduces Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis, a popular method for quantitatively assessing the performance of learning classifier systems. Next is the definition of “trouble-makers”, and how they were discovered, followed by a discussion of the development of two hybrids: an Evolutionary Programming-Adaptive boosting (EP-AB) and a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) oracle for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of the trouble-makers by using an ROC measure of performance analysis. That discussion is followed by a detailed discussion of how to perform and evaluate an ROC analysis as well as a detailed practice example for those readers not familiar with this measure of performance technology. This chapter concludes with a research study on how to use the oracle to establish if the data sample size is adequate to accurately meet a 95% confidence interval imposed on the variance (or standard deviation) for the oracle. This is an important research study as very little effort is generally put into establishing the correct data set size for accurate, predictable, and repeatable performance results.
