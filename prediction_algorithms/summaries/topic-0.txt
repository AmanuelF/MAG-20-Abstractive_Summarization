we propose the three vm utilization pattern refinement algorithms to iment algorithms to improve the original generated pattern by lowering the cap of the pattern , reducing cap provision duration and varying the minimum value of the pattern . we then adopt these refinement algorithms in an initial vm allocation mechanism and test them in trace - driven experiments and real - world cluster experiments . we consider the following cases to illustrate the three vm utilization pattern refinement algorithms . in the first case , the vm utilization pattern is modified to use a " hard cap " of 50 % the aim is to identify trace signals that are not in the noise and thain the noise and
