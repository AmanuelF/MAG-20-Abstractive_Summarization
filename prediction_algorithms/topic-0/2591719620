In this paper, we propose a novel regression-based method for employing privileged information to estimate the height using human metrology. The actual values of the anthropometric measurements are difficult to estimate accurately using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. Hence, we use ratios of anthropometric measurements as features. Since many anthropometric measurements are not available at test time in real-life scenarios, we employ a learning using privileged information (LUPI) framework in a regression setup. Instead of using the LUPI paradigm for regression in its original form (i.e., ϵ-SVR+), we train regression models that predict the privileged information at test time. The predictions are then used, along with observable features, to perform height estimation. Once the height is estimated, a mapping to classes is performed. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can estimate the height better and faster than the ϵ-SVR+ algorithm and report results for different genders and quartiles of humans.
