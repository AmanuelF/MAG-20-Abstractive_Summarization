Supervised classifiers are highly dependent on abundant labeled training data. Alternatives for addressing the lack of labeled data include: labeling data (but this is costly and time consuming); training classifiers with abundant data from another domain (however, the classification accuracy usually decreases as the distance between domains increases); or complementing the limited labeled data with abundant unlabeled data from the same domain and learning semi-supervised classifiers (but the unlabeled data can mislead the classifier). A better alternative is to use both the abundant labeled data from a source domain, the limited labeled data and optionally the unlabeled data from the target domain to train classifiers in a domain adaptation setting. We propose two such classifiers, based on logistic regression, and evaluate them for the task of splice site predictionâ€”a difficult and essential step in gene prediction. Our classifiers achieved high accuracy, with highest areas under the precision-recall curve between 50.83% and 82.61%.
