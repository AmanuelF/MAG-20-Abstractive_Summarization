Abstract Breast cancer is one of the most frequent cancers among women. Extensive studies into the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer have produced a plethora of molecular subtype classification and prognosis prediction algorithms, as well as numerous gene expression signatures. However, reimplementation of these algorithms is a tedious but important task to enable comparison of existing signatures and classification models between each other and with new models. Here, we present the genefu R/Bioconductor package, a multi-tiered compendium of bioinformatics algorithms and gene signatures for molecular subtyping and prognostication in breast cancer. The genefu package is available from Bioconductor. http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/genefu.html Source code is also available on Github https://github.com/bhklab/genefu bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
