Machine Learning for Disease Prediction Abraham Jacob Frandsen Department of Mathematics, BYU Master of Science Millions of people in the United States alone suffer from undiagnosed or late-diagnosed chronic diseases such as Chronic Kidney Disease and Type II Diabetes. Catching these diseases earlier facilitates preventive healthcare interventions, which in turn can lead to tremendous cost savings and improved health outcomes. We develop algorithms for predicting disease occurrence by drawing from ideas and techniques in the field of machine learning. We explore standard classification methods such as logistic regression and random forest, as well as more sophisticated sequence models, including recurrent neural networks. We focus especially on the use of medical code data for disease prediction, and explore different ways for representing such data in our prediction algorithms.
