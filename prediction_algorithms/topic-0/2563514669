We report on our progress in utilizing THz breath sensing in several bio-medical diagnostic applications. Our work bears promise in applying this technology to non-invasive analysis of blood glucose based on chemical composition of breath, as well as assessment of asthma related airway inflammation. Our most recent testing of CMOS based THz breath sensor, in the evolution of this technology towards compact and affordable implementations, is discussed.
