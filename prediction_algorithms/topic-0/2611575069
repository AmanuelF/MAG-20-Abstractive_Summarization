We describe a snapshot of an adaptive charging network (ACN) for electric vehicles at Caltech. We overview the system design, from the power distribution system to advanced charger design to control and communication system and the software system that integrates the overall network. We present a simple mathematical formulation of the charging problem. We have collected three months' of baseline charging data from the Caltech ACN. We demonstrate, by simulating a charging algorithm on the baseline data, the large potential benefit of ACN in saving infrastructure costs.
