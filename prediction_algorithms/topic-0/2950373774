Interactions between human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and peptides play a critical role in the human immune system. Accurate computational prediction of HLA-binding peptides can be used for peptide drug discovery. Currently, the best prediction algorithms are neural network-based pan-specific models, which take advantage of the large amount of data across HLA alleles. However, current pan-specific models are all based on the pseudo sequence encoding for modeling the binding context, which is based on 34 positions identified from the HLA protein-peptide bound structures in early works. In this work, we proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network model (DCNN) for HLA-peptide binding prediction, in which the encoding of the HLA sequence and the binding context are both learned by the network itself without requiring the HLA-peptide bound structure information. Our DCNN model is also characterized by its binding context extraction layer and dual outputs with both binding affinity output and binding probability outputs. Evaluation on public benchmark datasets shows that our DeepSeqPan model without HLA structural information in training achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large number of HLA alleles with good generalization capability. Since our model only needs raw sequences from the HLA-peptide binding pairs, it can be applied to binding predictions of HLAs without structure information and can also be applied to other protein binding problems such as protein-DNA and protein-RNA bindings.
