This paper presents a speech dereverberation algorithm combining adaptive multi-channel linear prediction (MCLP) with a statistical model for the undesired reverberation. More specifically, we propose to constrain the power of the MCLP-based late reverberation estimate with the late reverberant power estimated using the exponential decay model, thereby preventing excessive cancellation of the speech signal. Simulation results show that incorporating the constraint improves the performance of the adaptive dereverberation method when the prediction filters need to adapt quickly.
