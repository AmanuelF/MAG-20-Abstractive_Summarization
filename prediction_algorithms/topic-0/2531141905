Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated its successful applications in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. For object recognition, CNNs might be limited by its strict label requirement and an implicit assumption that images are supposed to be target-object-dominated for optimal solutions. However, the labeling procedure, necessitating laying out the locations of target objects, is very tedious, making high-quality large-scale dataset prohibitively expensive. Data augmentation schemes are widely used when deep networks suffer the insufficient training data problem. All the images produced through data augmentation share the same label, which may be problematic since not all data augmentation methods are label-preserving. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised CNN framework named Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (MILCNN) to solve this problem. We apply MILCNN framework to object recognition and report state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2015 classification dataset.
