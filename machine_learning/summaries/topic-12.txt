in the simple optimization problem , the optimal solution to a problemolution to a problem is defined by the optimal solution to the problem with the fewest iterations . this is a familiar problem for optimization researchers because it is easy to see how to find the optimal solution in the simple case of a single example . in the high capacity regime , however , the problem is more complex , and a deeper understanding of the problems involved requires
