our current paper demonstrates that this work is not entirely as simplot entirely as simple as it seems , and we offer a novel approach to learning a localizing cnn . we discuss the details of this approach in detail and present results on various training tasks , including object localization , face detection , and object detection for two different object classes . we also address the the resulting set of feature representations will provide a high - levprovide a high - level representation of the object representation , while avoiding the need to train a single feature - based model for all images . the resulting model will have a high degree of object segmentation performance , while
