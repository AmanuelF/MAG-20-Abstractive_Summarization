we define the perceptual loss function as a function of the input imagon of the input image and a pair of loss functions that correspond to the perceptual loss functions for the input image . we propose the perceptual loss functions as the form of a training data set , and use them to train the network . we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by applying it to image style transfer , super resolution , and image transfer in motion . we also demonstrate how the proposed approach we will present a new approach to the problem of learning large dataseearning large datasets from a large set of training examples . we have developed a method to automatically
