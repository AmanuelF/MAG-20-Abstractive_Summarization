the specific challenges are : how can we overcome this problem?in the this problem?in the present work , we propose a novel approach that addresses this problem by taking advantage of the fact that the dnns of the dnn - aware ml models are not necessarily complete representations of the inputs . our approach takes advantage of a feature - rich model that is built on top of the full training set of the dnn - aware ml models . we show that by explicitly constructing a
