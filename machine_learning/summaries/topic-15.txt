a potentially strong force in reinforcement learning is intrinsic moting is intrinsic motivation , which is when a behavior is intrinsically motivated . the goal of reinforcement learning is to generate behavior that is intrinsically motivated . this leads to the idea that all behavior is intrinsically motivated and that reinforcement learning is a process that can be performed by a deep neural network . the problem with intrinsic motivation is that it is not intuitive . it is not obvious that a behavior is intrinsically motivated , and the deep learning approach does not necessarily do this our approach is a flexible framework for exploring new behavior that i new behavior that is independent of the previous behavior of
