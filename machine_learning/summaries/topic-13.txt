we show that the deepxplore whitebox framework efficiently finds thousiciently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors ( e.g. , self - driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software ) in state - of - the - art dl models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets including imagenet and udacity self - driving challenge data . for all tested dl models , on average , deepxplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on soilgrids 250 m is the most complete and robust set of soil propertiest of soil properties data in the world and is freely available . soilgrids 250 m is the most accurate
