however , the transformation is often not so simple to apply . coral me to apply . coral minimizes domain shift by aligning the second - order statistics of source and target distributions , without requiring any target labels . even though it is extraordinarily simple – it can be implemented in four lines of matlab code – coral performs remarkably well in extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets . supervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed for the case when
