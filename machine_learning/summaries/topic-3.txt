to address this problem , we introduce the neural network architecturenetwork architecture - specific , optimization - based , data - driven approach to designing neural network architectures . this approach is inspired by neural networks that are tuned to a specific problem . we demonstrate that this approach is able to produce novel designs for different problems , outperforming previous approaches and outperforming existing deep learning architectures on a wide range of problems . our approach provides a new we suggest using these methods for more general tasks , such as image sks , such as image classification . we present an optimization algorithm that can be used to improve the performance of our network , by using the
