the results show that , when compared to prior policy search methods ,icy search methods , the deep visuomotor methods are significantly more accurate in predicting the probability of a given action , and that the performance of the deep visuomotor methods is also correlated with the size of the stimulus , suggesting that the results are robust to the visuomotor tasks . the results also show that deep visuomotor methods are more efficient at predicting the probability of a given action than prior policy search methods . the results
